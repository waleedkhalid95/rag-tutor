# Digital Undergraduate Tutor: Fine-Tuned LLMs & RAG

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Digital Undergraduate Tutor for Chemical Engineering students. The project combines fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, curriculum-appropriate responses to student queries.

## Repository Structure

- `/ocr_experiments/`: Optical Character Recognition experiments and implementations
- `/rag_prototypes/`: Retrieval-Augmented Generation prototypes and iterations
- `/model_fine_tuning/`: Scripts and notebooks for LLM fine-tuning
- `/data_processing/`: Data preprocessing and cleaning scripts
- `/deployment/`: Deployment scripts and configurations
- `/evaluation/`: Model evaluation scripts and results
- `/docs/`: Project documentation and reports

## Key Features

1. OCR implementation for complex chemical engineering texts
2. RAG system with copyright compliance
3. Fine-tuned Phi-3.5 mini model for chemical engineering domain
4. Local deployment for enhanced privacy and reduced carbon footprint
5. Integration with prescribed textbook content


## Usage

Refer to the README files in each component folder for detailed usage instructions.

## Important Note on Resource Management

Due to the extensive scope of the project and substantial GPU resource requirements, we utilize a combination of GitHub and Google Drive for file management:

- GitHub: Code repository and documentation
- Google Drive: Large file storage, vector database, and collaborative work

Our local GPU access is limited, necessitating the use of cloud resources for certain operations. The vector database is retrieved from SQL on Google Drive for prototyping. Google Drive integration with Google Colab facilitates our collaborative workflow.
