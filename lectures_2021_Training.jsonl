{"text": "### Query: Why is the shear rate highest at the wall of a pipeline? ### Response: The shear rate is highest at the wall of a pipeline due to the no-slip condition, where the fluid in direct contact with the wall moves at the same velocity as the wall itself, which is typically zero. As you move away from the wall towards the center of the pipeline, the fluid layers slide over each other more easily, resulting in a lower shear rate. This gradient in velocity from the wall to the center is what we observe as the shear rate, and it's highest at the wall because of the abrupt change from no movement to the flow speed of adjacent fluid layers. ### References: The no-slip condition at the wall results in the highest shear rate at this boundary due to the velocity gradient between the stationary wall and moving fluid. ###"}

In a dilute solution, the interactions between water molecules are similar to those in pure water, meaning the water's chemical potential, or 'activity', is higher. As the solution becomes more concentrated, the presence of solutes interferes with these interactions, reducing the water's activity.
