PREFACE The seventh edition of this text on the unit operations of chemical engineering con trains much new material and many additional problems but the basic structure general level of treatment and overall length are largely unchanged This is an in introductory text written for undergraduates in their junior or senior year who have completed the usual courses in mathematics chemistry physics and an introduce ton to chemical engineering An elementary knowledge of material and energy ball dances is assumed Because it contains up-to-date correlations for heat transfer mass transfer and equipment design this text should also be useful to chemists and engine needs in industry Separate chapters are devoted to each of the principal unit operations grouped into four sections fluid mechanics heat transfer mass transfer and related separate tons and operations involving particulate solids One-semester courses may be based on any of these sections or combinations of them Bioengineering is not treated as a separate topic but examples of food processing bioseparations, and if fusion in biological systems are included in various chapters Nearly all equations are written for SI units but the older cogs and ups systems have not been completely eliminated Chemical engineers must be familiar with all three systems of units Most of the equations are dimensionless and may be used with any set of consistent units NEW TO THIS EDITION i Thirty percent of the end-of-chapter problems are new or revised for this edition Nearly all the problems can be solved with the aid of a pocket calculator but for a few a computer solution is preferable * The section on fluid viscosity in chap 3 is expanded to include simple theories for gases and liquids In water chapters similar theories for thermal conductivity and diffusivity are discussed and comparisons made * The analogies among momentum transfer diffusion and heat conduction are given more emphasis and the section on transient diffusion is expanded to in clue an example of controlled-release drug delivery i New material in chap 25 deals with the use of powdered carbon to treat aqueous waste in tanks and expanded-bed adsorption that can be used for purification of fermentation broths : * Chapter 29 has a new section on diafiltration, a process often used in protein purification There is also an expanded treatment of ultrafiltration and microfilm ration of protein and polymer solutions * The discussion of filter cake washing is completely revised and a plot of some data is included exist

CHAPTER i Definitions and Principles Chemical engineering has to do with industrial processes in which raw materials are changed or separated into useful products The chemical engineer must develop design and engineer both the complete process and the equipment used choose the proper raw materials operate the plants efficiently safely and economically and see to it that products meet the requirements set by the customers Chemical engine needing is both an art and a science Whenever science helps the engineer to solve a problem science should be used when as is usually the case science does not give a complete answer it is necessary to use experience and judgment The professional stature of an engineer depends on skill in utilizing all sources of information to reach practical solutions to processing problems The variety of processes and industries that call for the services of chemical end gingers is enormous In the past the areas of most concern to chemical engineers were ore beneficiation, petroleum refining and the manufacture of heavy chemicals and organics such as sulfuric acid methyl alcohol and polyethylene Today items such as polymeric lithographic supports for the electronics industry high-strength composite materials genetically modified biochemical agents in areas of food pro messing and drug manufacture and drug delivery have become increasingly import tanto The processes described in standard treatises on chemical technology and the process and biochemical industries give a good idea of the field of chemical engineering * Because of the variety and complexity of modern processes it is not practical be to cover the entire subject matter of chemical engineering under a single head The field is divided into convenient but arbitrary sectors This text covers that port ton of chemical engineering known as the unit operations superscript numerals in the text correspond to the numbered references at the end of each chapter 3

+ SECTION i Introduction UNIT OPERATIONS An economical method of organizing much of the subject matter of chemical engine needing is based on two facts (1) Although the number of individual processes is great each one can be broken down into a series of steps called operations each of which in turn appears in process after process (2) the individual operations have come on techniques and are based on the same scientific principles For example in most processes solids and fluids must be moved heat or other forms of energy must be transferred from one substance to another and tasks such as drying size reduction distillation and evaporation must be performed The unit operation concept is this By studying systematically these operations these ves-âoperations that clearly cross industry and process linesâthe treatment of all processes is unified and simplified The strictly chemical aspects of processing are studied in a companion area of chemical engineering called reaction kinetics The unit operations are largely used to conduct the primarily physical steps of preparing the reactants separating and purifying the products recycling unconverted reactants and controlling the energy transfer into or out of the chemical reactor The unit operations are as applicable to many physical processes as to chemical ones For example the process used to manufacture common salt consists of the folk lowing sequence of unit operations transportation of solids and liquids transfer of heat evaporation crystallization drying and screening No chemical reaction ape pears in these steps On the other hands the cracking of petroleum with or without the aid of a catalyst is a typical chemical reaction conducted on an enormous scale Here the unit operationsâtransportation of fluids and solids distillation and varia out mechanical separationsâ-are vital and the cracking reaction could not be until liked without them The chemical steps themselves are conducted by controlling the flow of material and energy to and from the reaction zone Because the unit operations are a branch of engineering they are based on both science and experience Theory and practice must combine to yield designs for equipment that can be fabricated assembled operated and maintained A balanced discussion of each operation requires that theory and equipment be considered to gather This book presents such a balanced treatment Scientific foundations of unit operations A number of scientific principles and techniques are basic to the treatment of the unit operations Some are elementary physical and chemical laws such as the conservation of mass and energy physical equilibria kinetics and certain proper ties of matter Their general use is described in the remainder of this chapter Other special techniques important in chemical engineering are considered at the proper places in the text UNIT SYSTEMS The official international system of units is of system International dÂ°UnitÃ©s).

The correlations that have been found for this are given in chap 12. Correlating the experimental values of the three groups of variables of end (1.49) is clearly simpler than attempting to correlate the effects of each of the individual factors of end (1.42). Formation of other dimensionless groups If a pair of letters other than b and e is selected for retention three dimension less groups are again obtained but one or more differ from the groups of end (1.49). For example if b and fare kept the result is g dip put is prep ash AVpc, AT la k Other combinations may be found however it is unnecessary to repeat the algebra to obtain such additional groups The three groups in end (1.49) may be combined in any desired manner by multiplying and dividing them or reciprocals or mufti plus of them together It is necessary only that each original group be used at least once in finding new groups and that the final assembly contain exactly three groups For example end (1.51) is obtained from end (1.49) by multiplying both sides by (u/DVp)k/ Mcp): ad la k i dip call wok o dip cope a AT dip it mks due to and end (1.51) follows Note that function i is not equal to function i In this way any dimensionless equation may be changed into any number of new ones This is often useful when it is desired to isolate a single factor in one group thus in end (1.49) i appears in only one group and in end (1.51) k is found in only one to is shown in chap 12 that end (1.51) is more useful for some purposes than end (1.49). Speculative dimensional analysis As pointed out by Churchill. dimensional analysis is best looked upon as a speculative process For one thing the method does not guarantee that a simple exponential relationship such as end (1.48) ape plies although subsequent experiments may well show that such a relationship ts entirely satisfactory For another the choice of variables should often be consider red tentative in making a dimensional analysis If unnecessary variables are in eluded the analysis usually shows that they are not needed if important ones are left out the analysis may still give a valid result but only for certain limiting or as asymptotic conditions as for example at very low or very high flow rates Used core erectly dimensional analysis can be a most useful tool in designing an experimental program

BASIC CONCEPTS Underlying the unit operations of chemical engineering are a small number of basic concepts including the equations of state of gases material balances and energy balances These topics are treated extensively in introductory courses in chemistry and chemical engineering and because of this they are discussed only briefly here illustrative problems and answers are included at the end of this chapter for any one who wishes practice in applying these concepts Equations of State of Gases A pure gas consisting of n mom and held at a temperature T and pressure p will fill volume v If any of the three quantities are fixed the fourth also is determined and only three of these quantities are independent This can be expressed by the functional equation f(p.T, vine i (1.52) Specific forms of this relation are called equations of state Many such equations have been proposed and several are in common used The most satisfactory equal tons of state can be written in the form pa B c D we he a we + e we (1.53 next in (V/ny? i (V/n)3 ) This equation known as the viral equation is well substantiated by molecular gas theory Coefficients be c and do are called the second third and fourth viral chef ficients, respectively Each is a function of temperature and is independent of press sure Additional coefficients may be added but numerical values for coefficients beyond D are so little known that more than three are seldom used The viral equal ton also applies to mixtures of gases Then the viral coefficients depend on the temperature and composition of the mixture Rules are available for estimating the values of be c and D for mixtures from those of the individual pure gases Compressibility factor and molar density For engineering purposes end (1.53) often is written c 14 my B 4 pic + and (1.54) my rat me up > Big

22) SECTION to Introduction mass are interconvertible, and the sum of the two is constant rather than only ja In most engineering however this transformation is too small to be detected and in this book it is assumed that mass and energy are independent Conservation of mass requires that the materials entering any process either act cumulate or leave the process There can be neither loss nor gain Most of the processes considered in this book involve neither accumulation nor depletion and the law of conservation of matter takes the simple form that input equals output The law is often applied in the form of material balances The process is debited with everything that enters it and is credited with everything that leaves it The sum of the credits must equal the sum of the debits Material balances must hold over the entire process or equipment and over any part of it They must apply to all the man trial that enters and leaves the process and to any single material that passes through the process unchanged Energy balances An energy balance may be made for a process or part of a process that is sept rated from the surroundings by an imaginary boundary As in a mass balance input across the boundary must equal output plus any accumulation if conditions are steady and unvarying with time input equals output All forms of energy must be included in an energy balance In most flow processes some forms however such as magnetic surface and mechanical stress energies do not change and need not be considered The most important forms are kinetic energy potential energy enthalpy heat and work in electrochemical processes electric energy must be added to the list Energy balance for single-stream process As an example of a steady-flow process in which a single stream of material is treated consider the process shown in fig 1.1. The equipment is any device through which the material is passing as some the material is flowing through the system at a constant mass rate Consider the flow of m keg of material The entering stream has a velocity of up mes and is z m above the horizontal datum above which heights are measured Its enthalpy a quantity discussed later is he J/kg.

SECTION i Fluid Mechanics The behavior of fluids is important to process engineering generally and constitutes one of the foundations for the study of unit operations An understanding of fluids is essential not only for accurately treating problems in the movement of fluids through pipes pumps and all kinds of process equipment but also for the study of heat flow and the many separation operations that depend on diffusion and mass transfer The branch of engineering science that has to do with the behavior of fluids and fluids are understood to include liquids gases and vaporsâis called fluid me chanics. Fluid mechanics in turn is part of a larger discipline called continuum mechanics which also includes the study of stressed solids Fluid mechanics has two branches important to the study of unit operations fluid statics which treats fluids in the equilibrium state of no shear stress and fluid dynamics which treats fluids when portions of the fluid are in motion relative to other parts The chapters of this section deal with those areas of fluid mechanics that are imp portent to unit operations The choice of subject matter is but a sampling of the huge field of fluid mechanics generally Chapter 2 treats fluid statics and some of its imp portent applications Chapter 3 discusses the important phenomena appearing in flowing fluids Chapter 4 deals with the basic quantitative Jaws and equations of fluid flow Chapter 5 treats the flow of incompressible fluids through pipes chap 6 discusses the flow of compressible fluids and chap 7 describes flow past solids imp messed in the flowing fluid Chapter 8 deals with the important engineering tasks of moving fluids through process equipment and of measuring and controlling fluids in flow finally chap 9 covers mixing agitation and dispersion operations which in essence are applied fluid mechanics 29

CHAPTER 2 Fluid Statics and Its Applications Nature of fluids A fluid is a substance that does not permanently resist distortion An attempt to change the shape of a mass of fluid results in layers of fluid sliding over one another until a new shape is attained During the change in shape shear stresses exist the magnitudes of which depend upon the viscosity of the fluid and the rate of sliding but when a final shape has been reached all shear stresses will have disappeared A fluid in equilibrium is free from shear stresses at given temperature and pressure a fluid possesses a definite density which in engineering practice is usually measured in kilograms per cubic meter or pounds per cubic foot Although the density of all fluids depends on the temperature and pressure the variation in density with changes in these variables may be small or large If the density changes only slightly with moderate changes in temperature and pressure the fluid is said to be incompressible if the changes in density are signify cant the fluid is said to be compressible Liquids are generally considered to be incompressible and gases compressible The terms are relatives however and the density of a liquid can change appreciably if pressure and temperature are changed over wide limits also gases subjected to small percentage changes in pressure and temperature act as incompressible fluids and density changes under such conditions may be neglected without serious error The pressure in a static fluid is familiar as a surface force exerted by the fluid against a unit area of the walls of its container Pressure also exists at every point within a volume of fluid It is a scalar quantity at any given point its magnitude is the same in all directions shear is the lateral displacement of one layer of material relative to another layer by an external force Shear stress is defined as the ratio of this force to the area of the layer See chap 3. 31

CHAPTER 3 Fluid Flow Phenomena The behavior of a flowing fluid depends strongly on whether the fluid is under the influence of solid boundaries In the region where the influence of the wall is small the shear stress may be negligible and the fluid behavior may approach that of an ideal fluid one that is incompressible and has zero viscosity The flow of such an ideal fluid is called potential flow and is completely described by the principles of newtonian mechanics and conservation of mass The mathematical theory of pop tertial flow is highly developed but is outside the scope of this book Potential flow has two important characteristics (1) Neither circulations nor eddies can form within the stream so that potential flow is also called irrational flow and (2) rich ton cannot develop so that there is no dissipation of mechanical energy into heat Potential flow can exist at distances not far from a solid boundary A fund mental principle of fluid mechanics originally stated by prandial in 1904.* is that except for fluids moving at low velocities or possessing high viscosities, the effect of the solid boundary on the flow is confined to a layer of the fluid immediately adjacent to the solid wall This layer is called the boundary layer and shear and shear forces are confined to this part of the fluid Outside the boundary layer potential flow survives Most technical flow processes are best studied by consider in the fluid stream as two parts the boundary layer and the remaining guide In some situations such as flow in a converging nozzle the boundary layer may be neglected and in others such as flow through pipes the boundary layer fills the entire channel and there is no potential flow Within the current of an incompressible fluid under the influence of solid boundaries four important effects appears (1) the coupling of velocity-gradient and shear-stress fields (2) the onset of turbulence (3) the formation and growth of boundary layers and (4) the separation of boundary layers from contact with the solid boundary In the flow of compressible fluids past solid boundaries additional effects appears arising from the significant density changes that are characteristic of 45

Since the wall does not move the momentum is de livened to the wall as a shear force known as wall shear The shear stress shear force per unit area at the wall is denoted by ,.. Momentum is thus transferred from a region of high fluid velocity to one of low velocity much as heat flows from a region of high temperature to one at a lower temperature The rate of momentum transfer per unit area or momentum flux is governed by the velocity gradient du/dy. Equation (3.3) therefore states that the momentum flux normal to the direction of fluid flow is proportional to the velocity gradient with the viscosity as the proportionality factory The velocity gradient may be thought of as the driving force for momentum transfer The units of momentum flux are (kg-m/s)/m?-s or kg/m-s?, the same as the units for re since 1 name equals 1 gym - so Momentum transfer is analogous to conductive heat transfer resulting from a temperature gradient where the proportionality factor between the heat flux and temperature gradient is called the thermal conductivity This is shown by couriers law on page 295. In laminar flow momentum is transferred by viscous action as a result of the velocity gradient and the viscosity may be regarded as the conductive it of momentum transferred by this mechanism Momentum transfer is also analog goes to the transfer of material by molecular diffusion where the proportionality factor is the diffiesiviry of mass This is summarized in fuck's law page 528. viscidities of gasesjand liquids ) Ingases) momentum is transferred by molecules moving relatively large distances to regions where the velocity is lower The viscosity depends on the average moment tum of the molecules which is proportional to the molecular weight times the average _ velocity Since the velocity is proportional to (7/M)!"?, the viscosity is proportional to (MT)"".

CHAPTER i Fluid Flow Phenomena 53 TURBULENCE to has long been known that a fluid can flow through a pipe or conduit in two differ went ways At low flow rates the pressure drop in the fluid increases directly with the fluid velocity at high rates it increases much more rapidly roughly as the square of the velocity The distinction between the two types of flow was first demonstrated in a classic experiment by borne Reynolds, reported in 1883.'Â° A horizontal glass tube was immersed in a glass-walled tank filled with water A controlled flow of water could be drawn through the tube by opening a valve The entrance to the tube was flared and provision was made to introduce a fine filament of colored water from the overhead flask into the stream at the tube entrance refolds found that at low flow rates the jet of colored water flowed intact along with the mainstream and no cross-mixing occurred The behavior of the color band showed clearly that the water was flowing in parallel straight lines and that the flow was laminar When the flow rate was increased a velocity called the critical velocity was reached at which the thread of color became wavy and gradually disappeared as the dye spread unit firmly throughout the entire cross section of the stream of water This behavior of the colored water showed that the water no longer flowed in laminar motion but moved erratically in the form of crosscurrents and eddies This type of motion is turbulent flow refolds number and transition from laminar to turbulent flow refolds studied the conditions under which one type of flow changes to the other and found that the critical velocity at which laminar flow changes to turbulent now depends on four quantities the diameter of the tube and the viscosity density . and average linear velocity of the liquid furthermore he found that these four factors can be combined into one group and that the change in the kind of flow och curs at definite value of the group The grouping of variables so found was dip do Re = âââ = i (3.10) u v where D = diameter of tube V = average velocity of liquid {Eq. (4.11)] = viscosity of liquid p = density of liquid v = kinematic viscosity of liquid The dimensionless group of variables defined by end (3.10) is called the refolds number red It is one of the named dimensionless groups listed in happy 2. Its magnitude is independent of the units used provided the units are consistent Additional observations have shown that the transition from laminar to turbulent flow actually may occur over a wide range of refolds numbers In a pipe flow is always laminar at refolds numbers below 2,100, but laminar flow can persist in smooth tubes up to refolds numbers well above 2,100 by limit eating all disturbances at the inlet If the laminar flow at such high refolds numbers is disturbed however say by a fluctuation in velocity the flow quickly

54. SECTION 11: Fluid Mechanics becomes turbulent Disturbances under these conditions are amplified whereas at refolds numbers below 2,100 all disturbances are damped and the flow remains laminar At some flow rates a disturbance may be neither damped nor amplified the flow is then said to be neutrally stable Under ordinary conditions the flow in a pipe or tube is turbulent at refolds numbers above about 4,000. Between 2,100 and 4.000 a transition region is found where the flow may be either laminar or turn blent depending upon conditions at the entrance of the tube and on the distance from the entrance refolds number for non-newtonian fluids Since non-newtonian fluids do not have a single-valued viscosity independent of shear rate end (3.10) for the refolds number cannot be used The definition of a refolds number for such fluids is somewhat arbitrary a widely used definition for power law fluids is ' i pa a yuan red = ve(."_) my 3.1) and + 1 ka The basis of this somewhat complicated definition is discussed on page 117. The onset of turbulence occurs at refolds numbers above 2.100 with pseudoplastic fluids for which no < i Nature of turbulence Because of its importance in many branches of engineering turbulent flow has been extensively investigated in recent years and a large literature has accumulated on this subject's Refined methods of measurement have been used to follow in detail the actual velocity fluctuations of the eddies during turbulent flow and the results of such measurements have shed much qualitative and quantitative light on the nature of turbulence Turbulence may be generated in other ways than by flow through a pipe In general it can result either from contact of the flowing stream with solid boundaries or from contact between two layers of fluid moving at different velocities The first kind of turbulence is called wall turbulence and the second kind free turbulence Wall turbulence appears when the fluid flows through closed or open channels or past solid shapes immersed in the stream Free turbulence appears in the flow of a jet into a mass of stagnant fluid or when a boundary layer separates from a solid wall and flows through the bulk of the fluid Free turbulence is especially important in mixing which is the subject of chap 9. turbulent flow consists of a mass of eddies of various sizes coexisting in the flowing stream Large eddies are continually formed They break down into smaller eddies which in turn evolve still smaller ones finally the smallest eddies disarm pearl Ala given time and in a given volume a wide spectrum of eddy sizes exists The size of the largest eddy is comparable with the smallest dimension of the turbulent stream the diameter of the smallest eddies is 10 to 100 jump Smaller eddies than this are rapidly destroyed by viscous shear Flow within an eddy is
Page 72:
CHAPTER i Fluid Flow Phenomena i laminar Since even the smallest eddies contain about 10'* molecules all eddies are of macroscopic size and turbulent flow is not a molecular phenomenon Any given eddy possesses a definite amount of mechanical energy much like that of a small spinning top The energy of the largest eddies is supplied by the potential energy of the bulk flow of the fluid From an energy standpoint turbulence is a transfer process in which large eddies formed from the bulk flow pass their energy of rotation along a continuous series of smaller eddies This mechanical energy is not appreciably dissipated into heat during the breakup of large eddies into smaller ones but is passed along almost quantitatively to the smallest eddies It is finally converted to heat when the smallest eddies are obliterated by viscous action Energy conversion by viscous action is called viscous dissipation Deviating velocities in turbulent flow A typical picture of the variations in the instantaneous velocity at a given point in a turbulent flow field is shown in fig 3.3. This velocity is really a single compo went of the actual velocity vector all three components of which vary rapidly in magnitude and direction also the instantaneous pressure at the same point fluctu- ate rapidly and simultaneously with the fluctuations of velocity Oscillographs showing these fluctuations provide the basic experimental data on which modern theories of turbulence are based Although at first sight turbulence seems to be structureless and randomized studies of oscillographs like that in fig 3.3 show that this is not quite so The randomness and unpredictability of the fluctuations which are nonetheless con strained between definite limits exemplify the behavior of certain mathematical chaotic nonlinear functions Quantitative characterization of turbulence how ever is commonly done by statistical analysis of the frequency distributions The instantaneous local velocities at a given point can be measured by laser copper anemometers which are capable of following the rapid oscillations Local velocities can be analyzed by splitting each component of the total instantaneous velocity into two parts one a constant part that is the time average or mean value of the component in the direction of flow of the stream and the other called the deviating velocity the instantaneous fluctuation of the component around the mean The net velocity is that measured by ordinary flowmeters, such as a pilot tube 45% = i -5% FIGURE 3.3 Velocity fluctuations in turbulent flow The percentages are based on the constant velocity after F la Wattendorf and a my Kuethe, physics 52153 (1934).

CHAPTER i Fluid Flow Phenomena 59 Nearly isotropic turbulence exists when there is no velocity gradient as at the center line of a pipe or beyond the outer edge of a boundary layer Nearly isotropic turbulence is also found downstream of a grid placed in the flow Turbulent flow near a boundary is anisotropic but the anisotropy occurs mainly with the larger eddies Small eddies especially those near obliteration from viscous action are practically isotropic refolds stresses It has long been known that shear forces much larger than those occurring in laminar flow exist in turbulent flow wherever there is a velocity gradient across a shear plane The mechanism of turbulent shear depends upon the deviating velocities in anisotropic turbulence Turbulent shear stresses are called refolds stresses They are measured by the correlation coefficients of the type rye defined in end (3.17). To relate refolds stresses to correlations of deviating velocities the moment tum principle may be used Consider a fluid in turbulent flow moving in a positive x direction as shown in fig 3.5. Plane S is parallel to the bow The instantaneous velocity in the plane is Â«,, and the mean velocity is we Assume that i increases with ya the positive direction measured perpendicular to the layer so so that the velocity gradient duty is positive An eddy moving toward the wall has a negative value of uvea and its movement represents a mass flow rate p(âvâ) into the fluid below plane so The velocity of the eddy in the x direction is up or w + uwâ; if each such eddy cross in plane so is slowed down to the mean velocity up the rate of momentum transfer per unit area is p(âvâ)uâ. This momentum flux after time averaging for all eddies is a turbulent shear stress or refolds stress given by the equation T = pu'u' (3.19) Eddy viscosity By analogy with end (3.4), the relationship between shear stress and velocity gradient in a turbulent stream is used to define an eddy viscosity end , do the = eye i (3.20) my : FIGURE 3.5 , oo refolds stress v negative sign entering fluid below so V positive sign o leaving fluid below i i s y i Slope = 1/|du/dy} us i 0 up

Eddy viscidities and diffusivities are determined with difficulty and only by means of special instruments by experiments on the flow itself BOUNDARY LAYERS Flow in boundary layers A boundary layer is defined as that part of a moving fluid in which the fluid motion is influenced by the presence of a solid boundary As a specific example of boundary layer formation consider the flow of fluid parallel with a thin plate as shown in fig 3.6. The velocity of the fluid upstream from the leading edge of the plate is uniform across the entire fluid stream The velocity of the fluid at the intern face between the solid and fluid is zero The velocity increases with distance from the plate as shown in fig 3.6, Each of these curves corresponds to a definite value of xu the distance from the leading edge of the plate The curves change slope rapidly near the plate they also show that the local velocity approaches asymptotic call the velocity of the bulk of the fluid stream In fig 3.6 the dashed line of is so drawn that the velocity changes are confined between this line and the trace of the wall Because the velocity lines are asymptotic with respect to distance from the plate it is assumed in order to locate the dashed line definitely that the line passes through all points where the velocity is 99 percent of the bulk fluid velocity a...

Laminar and turbulent flow in boundary layers The fluid velocity at the solid-fluid interface is zero and the velocities close to the solid surface are of necessity small Flow in this part of the boundary layer very near the surface therefore is essentially laminar Actually it is laminar most of the time but occasionally eddies from the main portion of the flow or the outer region of the boundary layer move very close to the wall temporarily disrupting the velocity profile These eddies may have little effect on the average velocity profile near the wall but they can have a large effect on the profiles of temperature or concentration when heat or mass is being transferred to or from the wall This effect is most pro bounced for mass transfer in liquids Farther away from the surface the fluid velocities though less than the velocity of the undisturbed fluid may be fairly large and flow in this part of the boundary layer may become turbulent Between the zone of fully developed turbulence and the region of laminar flow is a transition or buffer layer of intermediate character Thus a turbulent boundary layer is considered to consist of three zones the viscous sublayer, the buffer layer and the turbulent zone The existence of a completely

When flow in the boundary layer is laminar the thickness z of the layer increases with xÂ°Â°, where x is the distance from the leading edge of the plate's For a short time after turbulence appears z increases with xu and then after turbulence is fully developed with xÂ°Â°.

The approximate length of straight pipe necessary for completion of the final velocity distribution is for laminar flow ay i = 0.05 Re (3.24) D where xu = transition length ad = diameter of pipe Equation (3.24), originally proposed by Nikuradse. was verified experimentally by ruthful and Prengle.'â Equation (3.24) shows that for a S0-mm- (2-in.-) ID pipe and a refolds number of 1,500, the transition length is 3.75 m (12.3 ft). If the fluid end tearing the pipe is turbulent and the velocity in the tube is above the critical the than position length is nearly independent of the refolds number and is about 40 to 50 pipe diameters with little difference between the distribution at 25 diameters and that at greater distances from the entrance For a 50-mm-ID pipe 2 to 3 m of

A boundary layer forms as before in the fluid flowing over the upstream face When the fluid reaches the edge of the plate however its momentum prevents it from making the sharp turn around the edge and it separates from the plate and proceeds outward into the bulk of the fluid Behind the plate is a backwater zone of strongly decelerated fluid in which large eddies called vertices are formed This zone is known as the wake The eddies in the wake are kept in motion by the shear stresses between the wake and the separated current They consume considerable mechanical energy and may lead to a large pressure loss in the fluid Direction of flow Varying velocity > eel see ââââ or she velocity we see to OO 7 So i Uniform velocity you âj-â i _ Ne ââââ|_ OO > = SS SS ass i _âââââ i so ââââ_â i CW2z=z= NE we i a Eddies be FIGURE 3.9 Flow past flat plate a flow parallel with plate be flow perpendicular to plate

CHAPTER i Fluid Flow Phenomena 65 Boundary layer separation occurs whenever the change in velocity of the fluid in either magnitude or direction is too large for the fluid to adhere to the solid surface It is most frequently encountered when there is an abrupt change in the flow channel such as a sudden expansion or contractions a sharp bend or an obstruction around which the fluid must flow As discussed in chap i page 126, separation may also occur from the velocity decrease in a smoothly diverging channel Because of the large energy losses resulting from the formation of a wake it is often desirable to minimize or prevent boundary layer separation In some cases this can be done by suction i.e., by drawing part of the fluid into the solid surface at the area of potent pal separation Most often however separation is minimized by avoiding sharp changes in the cross-sectional area of the flow channel and by streamlining any obi jets over which the fluid must flow For some purposes such as the promotion of heat transfer or mixing in a fluid boundary layer separation may be desirable SYMBOLS A area my or ft?; a of area on which shear force acts also constant in end (3.7) B Constant in end (3.7) D diameter m or it e Eddy viscosity pass or ib/ft-s, P fa Shear force N or i & Newton's law proportionality factory 32.174 to Ib/Ib, - so K Constant in end (3.8) ka Flow consistency index gym - sÂ°-" or tb/ft- $27" [Eq.

For flow of a liquid down either the inside or the outside of a pipe the layer thickness is usually a very small fraction of the pipe diameter and the refolds number is the same as for a flat plate end (4.60). Equation (4.59) for the thickness of a falling laminar film was first presented by Nusselt,â who used the result to predict heat-transfer coefficients for condense in vapors Measurements of film thickness on a vertical surface cops @ = i show that end (4.59) is approximately correct for Re * 1.000, but the thickness act ally varies with about 0.45 power of the refolds number and the lavers are thinner than predicted at how Re and thicker than predicted above Re = 1.000. The deviations may be due to ripples or waves in the films which are apparent even at quite low refolds numbers The transition from laminar to turbulent flow is not as easily detected as in pipe flow since the film is very thin and the ripples make it difficult to observe turbulence in the film A critical refolds number of 2,100 has often been used for layer flaw but film thickness measurements indicate a transition at Re * 1.200.

TURBULENT FLOW IN PIPES AND CHANNELS In turbulent flow through a closed channel the velocity at the interface between fluid and the solid wall is zero and except very infrequently there are no velocity components normal to the wall Within a thin volume immediately adjacent to the wall the velocity gradient is essentially constant and the flow is viscous most of the time This volume is called the viscous sublayer. Formerly it was assumed that this slayer had a definite thickness and was always free from eddies but measure meets have shown velocity fluctuations in the slayer caused by occasional eddies from the turbulent fluid moving into this region Very close to the wall eddies are infrequent but there is no region that is completely free of eddies Within the visa cops slayer only viscous shear is important and eddy diffusion if present at all is minor The viscous slayer occupies only a very small fraction of the total cross sect tiny It has no sharp upper boundary and its thickness is difficult to define A transit ton layer exists immediately adjacent to the viscous slayer in which both viscous shear and shear due to eddy diffusion exist The transition layer which is sometimes called a buffer layer also is relatively think The bulk of the cross section of the flow in stream is occupied by entirely turbulent flow called the turbulent core In the turbulent core viscous shear is negligible in comparison with that from eddy viscosity Velocity distribution for turbulent flow Because of the dependence of important flow parameters on the velocity district button considerable study both theoretical and experimental has been devoted to determining the velocity distribution in turbulent flow Although the problem has not been completely solved useful relationships are available that may be used to calculate the important characteristics of turbulence and the results of theoretical calculations check with experimental data reasonably well A typical velocity distribution for a newtonian fluid moving.in turbulent flow in a smooth pipe at a refolds number of 10,000 is shown in fig 5.3. The figure also shows the velocity distribution for laminar flow at the same maximum velocity a the center of the pipe The curve for turbulent flow is clearly much flatter than that for laminar flow and the difference between the average velocity and the maximum velocity is considerably less At still higher refolds numbers the curve for turbo lent flow would be even flatter than that in fig 5.3. In turbulent flow as in laminar flow the velocity gradient is zero at the cent terrine is known that the eddies in the turbulent core are large but of low intend sit and those in the transition zone are small but intense Most of the kinetic energy content of the eddies lies in the buffer zone and the outer portion of the turbulent core At the centering the turbulence is isotropic In all other areas of

The kinetic energy correction factor may be important in applying Bernoulliâs theorem between stations when one is in laminar flow and the other in turbulent flow Also factors a and f are of some importance in certain types of compact heat exchange equipment where there are many changes in size of the fluid channel and where the tubes or heat-transfer surfaces themselves are short In most practical situations both are taken as unity in turbulent flow Relations between maximum velocity and average velocity The quantities Re and ratio V bitmap are useful in relating the average velocity to the maximum velocity in the center of the tube as a function of flow conditions for example an important method of measuring fluid flow is the pilot tube page 237), which can be used to measure u,,,,, and this relationship is then used to determine the average velocity from this single observation Experimentally measured values of V/umax as a function of the refolds numb be are shown in fig 5.8, which covers the range from laminar flow to turbulent flow For laminar flow the ratio is exactly 0.5, in accordance with end (5.19). The radio changes rapidly from 0.5 to about 0.7, when laminar flow changes to turbulent and then increases gradually to 0.87 when Re = 10Â°. Effect of roughness The discussion thus far has been restricted to smooth tubes without defining smoothness It has long been known that in turbulent flow a rough pipe leads to a larger friction factor for a given refolds number than a smooth pipe does If a for page no of sorry part | to we we i i i in | 0.9 â-L. | i re i . a to . to i el l ; | to tit dot , 08 pe = | it ya i to L call ; ~ i | we > i : | I | | of |-ââ:--7, i teat | | join | of it the | | reel i i Pall 0.6 we \ | { boy | : pet bop to Ln t | { T it pig i i ofay fan 0.5 = a 10? 104 105 10Â° do pop FIGURE 5.8 .

it section if Fluid Mechanics refolds number A log-log plot of end (5.22) is a straight line with a slope of ~1. This plot line is shown on fig 5.10 for refolds numbers less than 2,100. For turbulent flow the lowest line represents the friction factor for smooth tubes and is consistent with end (5.50). A much more convenient empirical equation for this line is the relation f = 0.046 Re~Â®? (5.53) This applies over a range of refolds numbers from about 50,000 to 1 x 10Â° Another equation applicable over a range of refolds numbers from 3.000 to 3 ex 10%, is 0.125 - f = 0.0014 i see (5.54) The other curved lines in the turbulent flow range represent the friction factors for various types of commercial pipe each of which is characterized by a different value of ka The parameters for several common metals are given in the figure Clean wrought-iron or steel pipe for example has a value of 1.5 x 1077 to regardless of the diameter of the pipe Drawn copper and brass pipe may be considered hydraulic call smooth For steel pipe and other rough pipes the friction factor becomes independent of the refolds number for refolds numbers greater than 10Â°. An empirical equation for this region is f = 0.026(k/D)Â°*4 (5.55) For different flow regimes in a given system the variation of pressure drop with flow rate can be found from else (5.9), (5.22), (5.53), and (5.55), to give For laminar flow are < 2,100) appal i v For turbulent flow (2,500 i Re < 10% = Ap/LaÂ« van For very turbulent flow are > 10Â°) appal x i Figure 5.10 is useful for calculating i from a known pipe size and flow rate but it cannot be used directly to determine the flow rate for a given pressure drop since Re is not known until V is determined however when end (5.53) applies and the pressure drop at one velocity is known the velocity at a different pressure drop is readily found as shown in Example 5.1. .

The friction loss he from a sudden expansion of cross section is proportional to the velocity head of the fluid in the small conduit and can be written v Ma my = we (5.64) where ka is a proportionality factor called the expansion loss coefficient and van is the average velocity in the smaller or upstream conduit In this case the calculation of ka can be made theoretically and a satisfactory result obtained The calculation utilizes the continuity equation (4.13), the steady-flow momentum-balance equal ton (4.51), and the Bernoulli equation (4.71). Consider the control volume defined by sections a and be and the inner surface of the larger downstream conduit be tween these sections as shown in fig 5.13.

A correction for @ and f should be made if the type of flow between the two sections differs For example if the flow in the larger pipe is laminar and that in the smaller pipe turbulent a should be taken as 2 and i as 3 in else (5.65) and (5.66). Friction loss from sudden contraction of cross section When the cross section of the conduit is suddenly reduced the fluid stream can not follow around the sharp corner and the stream breaks contact with the wall of the conduit A jet is formed which flows into the stagnant fluid in the smaller sect tiny The jet first contracts and then expands to fill the smaller cross section and downstream from the point of contraction the normal velocity distribution event ally is reestablished The cross section of minimum area at which the jet changes from a contraction to an expansion is called the vena contract The flow pattern of a sudden contraction is shown in fig 5.14. Section c is drawn at the vena con tractor Vortices appear as shown in the figure The friction loss from sudden contraction is proportional to the velocity head in the smaller conduit and can be calculated by the equation v my = ka > (5.70) where the proportionality factor is called the contraction loss coefficient and v is the average velocity in the smaller or downstream section experimentally for laminar flow ka < 0.1, and the contraction loss my is negligible For turbulent flow

The velocity at the vena contract is then about v /0.6 and the kinetic energy is (1/0.6) or 2.8 times the kinetic energy of the final stream however according to end (5.68), the fractional energy loss as the stream expands beyond the vena contract is only i i 0.6), or a loss of 0.16 x 2.8 x v /2, which corresponds to ka = 0.44. Effect of fittings and valves Fittings and valves disturb the normal flow lines and cause friction In short lines with many fittings the friction loss from the fittings may be greater than that from the straight pipe The friction loss he from fittings is found from an equation similar to else (5.64) and (5.70): i hop = up (5.72) , 2 where ka = loss factor for fitting van = average velocity in pipe leading to fitting Factor ka is found by experiment and differs for each type of connection A short list of factors is given in Table 5.1.

The velocities of 2 to 4 mes in Examples 5.1 and 5.2 are typical for liquid flow in medium-size pipes The optimum velocity or optimum pipe size for a given flow rate depends on pumping costs and capital charges and an empirical equation for optimum velocity is given in chap 8. For gas flows the optimum velocity is much larger than for liquids because of the lower density Velocity heads As shown by end (5.74), the friction loss in a complicated flow system can be expressed as a number of velocity heads defined as V?/2 for V?/(2g,) in ups units It is a measure of the momentum loss resulting from flow through the pipe or fit tag In a tee used as an elbow for example all the momentum in one direction is lost as the stream turns 90Â°, whereas in a standard 90Â° elbow only three-fourths of it is lost In an open globe valve illustrated in fig 5.15, the flow makes two 90Â° turns and passes through a constriction expanding again on the other side These changes in velocity and direction lead to a friction loss of 6 velocity heads A rapid practical method of estimating friction in straight pipe is as follows By setting 4f{(L/D) = 1.0, it follows from end (5.7) that a length equal to a definite number of pipe diameters generates a friction loss equal to | velocity head since in turbulent flow f varies from about 0.01 to about 0.002, the number of pipe damn meters equivalent to a velocity head is from 1/(4 x 0.01) = 25 10 I/(4 x 0.002) = 125. depending upon the refolds number For ordinary practice 50 pipe diameters is assumed for this factory thus if the pipe in the system of fig 5.15 is standard 2-in. steel actual ad 2.07 in and is 100 it long the skin friction is equity agent to (100 x 12)/(2 x 50) = 12 velocity heads In this case the friction from the single fitting and the expansion and contraction are negligible in comparison with that in the pipe In other cases where the pipes are short and the fittings and expansion and contraction losses numerous the friction Joss in the pipes only may be negligible . Separation from velocity decrease Boundary layer separation can occur even where there is no sudden change in cross section if the crass section is continuously enlarged For example consider the How of a fluid stream through the trumpet-shaped expander shown in fig 5.16. Because of the increase of cross section in the direction of flow the velocity of the fluid decreases and by the Bernoulli equation the pressure must increase Consider two stream filaments one aah very near the wail and the other be a short distance

Minimizing expansion and contraction losses A contraction loss can be nearly eliminated by reducing the cross section grade rally rather than suddenly For example if the reduction in cross section shown in fig 5.14 is obtained by a conical reducer or by a trumpet-shaped entrance to the smaller pipe the contraction coefficient ka can be reduced to approximately 0.05 for all values of $,/S,,. Separation and vena contract formation do not occur unless the decrease in cross section is sudden

It is assumed that a very large supply of gas at specified temperature and pressure and at zero velocity and much number is available The origin of the gas is called the reservoir and the temperature and pressure of the gas in the reservoir are called reservoir conditions The reservoir temperature is a stagnation value which does not necessarily apply at other points in the flow system Convergent section a Divergent section Reservoir \ see Receiver a 3 8 They > Isentropic section it + ---â-âââ Friction section â---- â---â>-â--+ recti Reservoir Adiabatic receiver PET i aS we a Thermal insulation Reservoir c Isentropic section Receiver [ Friction section Isothermal up end i feed to oo Heating jacket FIGURE 6.1 a isentropic flow in a convergent-divergent nozzle be Adiabatic friction flow act Isothermal friction flow

CHAPTER i Flow of Compressible Fluids 139 From the reservoir the gas is assumed to flow without friction loss at the entrance into and through a pipe The gas leaves the pipe at definite temperature velocity and pressure and goes into an exhaust receiver in which the pressure may be independently controlled at a constant value less than the reservoir pressure Within the pipe any one of the following processes may occur 1. Isentropic expansion In this process the cross-sectional area of the conduit must change and the process is described as one of variable area Because the process is adiabatic the stagnation temperature does not change in the conduit Such a process is shown diagrammatically in fig 6.1a. 2. Adiabatic friction flow through a pipe of constant cross section This process is irreversible and the entropy of the gas increases but as shown by end (6.22), since Q = i the stagnation temperature is constant throughout the conduit This process is shown in fig 6.10. , 3. Isothermal friction flow through a pipe of constant cross-sectional area accord panned by a flow of heat through the pipe wall sufficient to keep the temperature constant This process is nonadiabatic and nonisentropic; the stagnation temper nature changes during the process since / is constant and by end (6.20), i changes with we The process is shown in fig 6.1e. The changes in gas temperature density pressure velocity and stagnation temperature are predictable from the basic equations The purpose of this section is to demonstrate how these three processes can be treated analytically on the basis of such equations ISENTROPIC FLOW THROUGH NOZZLES A conduit suitable for isentropic flow is called a nozzle As shown in fig 6.la. a complete nozzle consists of a convergent section and a divergent section joined by a throat which is a short length where the wall of the conduit is parallel with the axis of the nozzle For some applications a nozzle may consist of a divergent section only and the throat connects directly with the receiver The configuration of an actual nozzle is controlled by the designer who fixes the relation between so the cross-sectional area and la the length of the nozzle measured from the entrance Nozzles are designed to minimize wall friction and to suppress boundary layer separation The convergent section is rounded and can be short since separation does not occur in a converging channel To suppress separation in the divergent section the diverging angle is made small and this section is therefore relatively long The nozzle entrance is sufficiently large relative to the throat to permit the velocity at the entrance to be taken as zero and the temperature and pressure at the entrance to be assumed equal to those in the reservoir Generalized treatments including general heat transfer to and from the gas injection of gas into the conduit variations in specific heat and molecular weight chemical reactions the drag of internal bodies and change of phase are given in refs | and 3.

140 secTION 112 Fluid Mechanics the purpose of the convergent section is to increase the velocity and decrease the pressure of the gas At low much numbers the process conforms essentially to the usual Bernoulli relation for incompressible flow [Eq. (4.67)]. In the convergent sect ton flow is always subsonic but it may become sonic at the throat much numbers greater than unity cannot be generated in a convergent nozzle In the divergent sect on the flow may be subsonic or supersonic The purpose of the divergent section differs sharply in the two situations In subsonic flow the purpose of the section is to reduce the velocity and regain pressure in accordance with the Bernoulli equation An important application of these nozzles is the measurement of aid flow which is discussed in chap 8. In supersonic flow the usual purpose of the divergent section is to obtain much numbers greater than unity for use in jet engines equipment used lo produce very fine sprays or experimental equipment such as wind tunnels Flow through a given nozzle is controlled by fixing the reservoir and receiver pressures For a given flow through a specific nozzle a unique pressure exists at each point along the axis of the nozzle The relation is conveniently shown as a plot of pop versus la where pa is the reservoir pressure and p the pressure at point la Figure 6.2 shows how the pressure ratio varies with distance and how changes in receiver pressure at constant reservoir pressure affect the pressure distribution The pressures at the throat and in the receiver are denoted by pa and put respectively If pa and my are equal no flow occurs and the pressure distribution is represented by line aah If the receiver pressure is slightly below the reservoir pressure flow occurs and a pressure distribution such as that shown by line arc is established Pressure recovery in the convergent section is shown by line be The maximum velocity occurs at the throat If the receiver pressure is further reduced the flow rate and the velocity throughout the nozzle increase A limit is attained when the velocity at the throat becomes sonic This case is shown by line are where pa = put up = a and Ma = i The ratio put of is called the critical pressure ratio and is denoted by re Flow is subsonic at all other points on line are for we a c e P:/P9 P------ 3 - t | P*/R9 on & } 3 7 i | h ! f can a we i we 0 tâ-ââ_ FIGURE 6.2 Variation of pressure ratio with distance from nozzle inlet

The flow rate attains its maxi mum at point a which is reached when the pressure ratio in the throat is reduced to its critical value Further reduction in pressure pa does not change the flow rate The reason for this is as follows When the velocity in the throat is sonic and the cross-sectional area of the conduit is constant sound waves cannot move upstream into the throat and the gas in the throat has no way of receiving a message from down stream Further reduction of the receiver pressure cannot be transmitted to the throat If the receiver pressure is reduced to the level shown by point f in fig 6.2. the pressure distribution is represented by the continuous line adg/f. This line is unique fora given gas and nozzle Only along the path deaf is supersonic flow possible If the receiver pressure is reduced below that of point i for example to point 4. the pressure at the end of the nozzle remains at that of point f and flow through the nozzle remains unchanged On issuing from the nozzle into the receiver the gas sure fears a sudden pressure drop from that of point f to that of point i The pressure change is accompanied by wave phenomena in the receiver If the receiver pressure is held at a level between points e and fa pressure distribution curves of the type doggie and dhhâj are found Sections dg and do represent isentropic supersonic flow The sudden pressure jumps get and the represent shock waves where the flow changes suddenly from supersonic to subsonic Shocks are thermodynamically erred versicle and are accompanied by an increase in entropy in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics Curves of and fa represent subsonic flows in which ordinary pressure recovery is taking place The area below line aught is not accessible to any kind of adiabatic flow Isentropic flow is confined to the subsonic area area's and the single line deaf The qualitative discussions of figs 6.2 and 6.3 apply to the flow of any come possible fluid Quantitative relations are most easily found for ideal gas flow

The apparent anomaly of supersonic flow is a result of the variation in density and velocity along an isentropic path Since the mass flow rate is the same at all points in the nozzle by continuity the cross-sectional area of the nozzle must vary inversely with the mass velocity up The velocity steadily increases with much number and the density decreases however at Ma = i the value of G goes through a maximum In the subsonic regime the velocity increases faster than the density decreases the mass velocity increases and 5 decreases In the supersonic regime the increase in velocity is overcome by a sharper de crease in density the mass velocity decreases and S increases to accommodate the total mass flow This behavior of G is demonstrated by studying the first and sect and derivatives of end (6.30) in the usual manner for investigating maxima and minimal

In adiabatic friction flow the temperature of the gas changes The viscosity also varies and the refolds number and friction factor are not actually constant In gas flow however the effect of temperature on viscosity is small and the effect of refolds number on the friction factor is still less also unless the much number is nearly unity the temperature change is small It is satisfactory to use an average value for f as a constant in call culations. If necessary f can be evaluated at the two ends of the conduit and an arithmetic average used as a constant Friction factors in supersonic flow are not well established apparently they are approximately one-half those in subsonic flow for the same refolds number In all the integrated equations in the next section it is assumed that the entrance to the conduit is rounded to form an isentropic convergent nozzle If supersonic flow in the conduit is required the entrance nozzle must include a divergent section to generate a much number greater than 1.

CHAPTER 7 Flow Past Immersed Objects The discussion in chaps 4 and 5 centered on the laws of fluid flow and factors that control changes of pressure and velocity of fluids flowing past solid boundaries and was especially concerned with flow through closed pipes and channels Emphasis during the discussion was placed primarily on the fluid In many problems how ever the effect of the fluid on the solid is of interest The fluid may be at rest and the solid moving through it the solid may be at rest and the fluid flowing past it or both may be moving The situation in which the solid is immersed the and surrounded by fluid is the subject of this chapter It is generally immaterial which phase solid or fluid is assumed to be at rest and it is the relative velocity between the two that is important An exception to this is seen in some situations when the fluid stream has been previously influenced by solid walls and is in turbulent flow The scale and intensity of turbulence then may be important parameters in the process DRAG AND DRAG COEFFICIENTS The force in the direction of flow exerted by the fluid on the solid is called drag By newton's third law of motion an equal and opposite net force is exerted by the obi jet on the fluid When the wall of the object is parallel with the direction of flow as in the case of the thin flat plate shown in fig 3.9a, the only drag force is the wall shear the More generally however the wall of an immersed object makes an angle with the direction of flow Then the component of the wall shear in the direction of flow contributes to drag Another contribution comes from the fluid pressure which acts in a direction normal to the wall drag comes from the pressure component in the direction of flow The total drag on an element of area is the sum of the two come ponents. An extreme example is the drag of a flat plate perpendicular to the flow as shown in fig 3.96, where the drag is due entirely to the pressure component 155

CHAPTER i Flow Past Immersed Objects 159 of the various factors that control form drag and wall drag Their effects can be followed by discussing the case of the sphere For low refolds numbers the drag force for a sphere conforms to a theoretic can equation called stokes law which may be written up = 32 pudgy (7.3) The equation for the terminal velocity of a sphere at low refolds numbers end (7.40), is also called stokes law From qi (7.3), the drag coefficient predicted by stokes law using end (7.1), is 24 to = red (7.4) In theory stokes law is valid only when red is considerably less than unity practically as shown by the left-hand portion of the graph of fig 7.3, else (7.3) and (7.4) may be used with small error for all refolds numbers less than 1. At the low velocities at which the law is valid the sphere moves through the fluid by deform in it The wall shear is the result of viscous forces only and inertial forces are negligible The motion of the sphere affects the fluid at considerable distances from the object and if there is a solid wall within 20 or 30 diameters of the sphere stokes law must be corrected for the wall effect The type of flow treated in this law is called creeping flow The law is especially valuable for calculating the resistance of small particles such as dust or fogs moving through gasps or liquids of low viscosity or for the motion of larger particles through highly viscous liquids As the refolds number increases beyond red = i the flow pattern behind the sphere becomes different from that in front of the sphere and the drag coefficient becomes greater than the stokes law limit of 24/Re,. At a refolds number of about 20, a zone of recirculating flow develops near the rear stagnation point The recirculation zone or wake increases in size with increasing refolds number and at red = 100 the wake covers nearly one-half of the sphere The large eddies or for times in the wake dissipate considerable mechanical energy and cause the pressure to be much less than the upstream pressure This makes the form drag quite large relative to the drag caused by wall shear At moderate refolds numbers of 200 to 300, oscillations develop in the wake and vortices disengage from the wake in a regular fashion forming in the down stream fluid a series of moving vortices or a vortex street illustrated in fig 7.4. A similar vortex street is formed when a fluid flows across wires or long cylinders and is responsible for the hum of telephone wires in the wind The frequency of via ration can be used to measure flow rate as described in chap 8. For red = 10Â° to 10Â° the drag coefficient is nearly constant at 0.40 to 0.45, changing only slightly as the point of boundary layer separation slowly shifts toward the nose of the sphere Figure 7.5a shows the flow pattern for red = 10Â°, where the boundary layer on the front part of the sphere is still laminar and the angle of separation is 85Â°. When the front boundary layer becomes turbulent at red = 300,000, the separation point moves toward the rear of the sphere and the wake shrinks as shown in fig 7.5b. The remarkable drop in the drag coefficient from 0.45 to 0.10 is the result of this decrease in the size of the wake and the corner spending decrease in form drag

One method of measuring the scale of turbulence is to determine the write kcal refolds number and use a known correlation between the two quantities The curve of up versus red for an infinitely long cylinder normal to the flow is much like that for a sphere but at how refolds numbers my does not vary

CHAPTER i Flow Past Immersed Objects 161 inversely with red because of the two-dimensional character of the flow around the cylinder For short cylinders such as catalyst pellets the drag coefficient falls between the values for spheres and long cylinders and varies inversely with the refolds number at very low refolds numbers Disks do not show the drop in drag coefficient at a critical refolds number because once the separation occurs at the edge of the disk the separated stream does not return to the back of the disk and the wake does not shrink when the boundary layer becomes turbulent Bodies that show this type of behavior are called bluff bodies For a disk the drag coefficient can is approximately unity at refolds numbers above 2,000. The drag coefficients for irregularly shaped particles such as coal sand or crushed stone are greater than for spheres of the same nominal size Data for crushed limestone at red = 4 to 400 are shown in fig 7.7, page 170. Other less of irregular solids gave drag coefficients 2 to 3 times those for spheres at refolds numbers of 1,000 to 2,000. Results for isometric particles such as cubes and tetra hydra have also been reported.-? Form drag and streamlining Form drag can be minimized by forcing separation toward the rear of the object This is accomplished by streamlining The usual method of streamlining is to so proportion the rear of the object that the increase in pressure in the boundary layer which is the basic cause of separation is sufficiently gradual to delay separate tiny Streamlining usually calls for a pointed rear like that of an airfoil A typical streamlined shape is shown in fig 7.6. A perfectly streamlined object would have no wake and little or no form drag Stagnation point The streamlines in the fluid flowing past the object in fig 7.6 show that the fluid stream in the plane of the section is split by the object into two parts one passing over the top of the object and the other under the bottom stream line a divides the two parts and terminates at a definite point 8 at the nose of the body This point is caNed a stagnation point The velocity at a stagnation point is âââ we to i of Be I i the end 23 > â_+__ to see i Sib an we lot to is GS lie - a a a FIGURE 7.6 Sucamlined object abs streamline to stagnation point be

CHAPTER i Flow Past Immersed Objects 163 FLOW THROUGH BEDS OF SOLIDS In many technical processes liquids or gases flow through beds of solid particles Important examples are filtration and the two-phase countercurrent flow of liquid and gas through packed towers In filtration the bed of solids consists of small part uncles that are removed from the liquid by a filter cloth or fine screen In other equip went such as ion-exchange or catalytic reactors a single fluid liquid or gas flows through a bed of granular solids Filtration is discussed in chap 29 and packed town ears in chap 18. The present treatment is restricted to the flow of a single fluid phase through a column of stationary solid particles The resistance to the flow of a fluid through the voids in bed of solids is the resultant of the total drag of all the particles in the bed Depending on the refolds number D,G,/j, laminar flow turbulent flow form drag separation and wake formation occur As in the drag of a single solid particles there is no sharp transition between laminar and turbulent flow like that occurring in flow through pipes and channels of constant cross section The most common methods of calculating the pressure drop through a bed of solids are based on estimates of total drag on the solid boundaries of the tortuous channels through the bed The actual channels are irregular in shape have a variable cross section and orientation and are highly interconnected however to calculate an equivalent channel diameter it is assumed that the bed has a set of uniform circular channels whose total surface area and void vole me match those of the bed The total surface area is the surface area per particle times the number of particles but it is more convenient to base the calculation on the volume fraction particles in the bed and the surface-volume ratio for the part unless This ratio is 6/D,, for a sphere since so = 7 did and up = 37 do For other shapes or irregular particles the equation for surface-volume ratio includes a sphericity Â®,, defined as the surface-volume ratio for a sphere of diameter do divided by the surface-volume ratio for the particle whose nominal size is do Thus i up soup so 6 10 or v = Â®.D, (7.10) Values of the sphericity of several shapes are given in Table 7.1.

The volume fraction particles in the bed is | i i where i is the porosity or void fraction If the particles are porous the pores are generally too small to permit any significant flow through them so i is taken to be the external void fraction of the bed and not the total porosity

There is no sharp transition to turbulent flow at this refolds number but the frequent changes in shape and direction of the channels in the bed lead to significant kinetic energy losses at higher refolds numbers The constant {50 corresponds to i = 2.1, which is a reasonable value for the tortuosity factory For a given system end (7.17) indicates that the flow is proportional to the pressure drop and inversely proper tonal to the fluid viscosity This statement is also known as day's flaw which is often used to describe flow of liquids through porous media As the flow rate through a packed bed increases the slope of the Ap-versus- up plot gradually increases and at very high refolds numbers a varies with the 1.9 or 2.0 power of the superficial velocity If the usual equation for turbulent flow in pipes [Eq.

This means that the correction factor 4. i 1.75/0.03 = 58. which is much too large to explain by the tortuosity of the channels or roughness of the particle surfaces The main contribution to the pressure drop must be the kinetic energy losses caused by changes in channel cross section and flow direction As the fluid passes between particles the channel becomes smaller and then larger and the maximum velocity is much greater than the average velocity Since the channel area changes rapidly most of the kinetic energy of the fluid is most as an expansion Joss see end (5.67)].

This number is greater than 1.0, because the local velocity at narrow places in the flow channels may be 2 to 3 times the average velocity v and much kinetic energy is lost as the fluid passes through each layer of particles An equation covering the entire range of flow rates can be obtained by assume in that the viscous losses and the kinetic energy losses are additive The result is called the run equation a _ 150Vou of + L75eV6lâe (1.20) L odd et odd i run showed that end (7.22) fitted data for spheres cylinders and crushed solids over a wide range of flow rates He also varied the packing density for some materials to verify the i i Â¢)*/e? term for the viscous loss part of the equation and the i i Â¢)/e? term for the kinetic energy part Note that a small change in i has a very large effect on ape which makes it difficult to predict a accurately and to reproduce experimental values after a bed is repacked The void fractions for spheres cylinders and granular packing generally range from 0.3 to 0.6 depending on the ratio of particle size to tube size and the method of packing Some data by Leva and drummer for dumped packing are given in Table 7.2.

At superficial velocities somewhat greater than come most of the gas passes through the bed as bubbles or voids which are almost free of solids and only a small fraction of the gas flows in the channels between the particles The part clues move erratically and are supported by the fluid but in the space between bubbles ' the void fraction is about the same as that at incipient fluidization. The nonuniform nature of the bed was at first attributed to aggregation of the particles and the term aggregative fluidization was applied but there is no evidence that the particles stick together and the term bubbling fluidization is a better description of the phenomenon The bubbles that form behave much as air bubbles in water or bubbles of vapor in a boiling liquid and the term boiling bed is sometimes applied to this type of fluidize tiny Studies that account for the rates of beat or mass transfer or chemical reaction in a bubbling bed often refer to the two-phase theory of fluidization, in which the bub blew are one phase and the dense bed of suspended particles is the second phase The behavior of a bubbling fluidized bed depends very strongly on the number and size of the gas bubbles which are often hard to predict The average bubble size depends on the nature and size distribution of the particles the type of distributor plate the superficial velocity and the depth of the bed Bubbles tend to coalesce and grow as they rise through the fluidized bed and the maximum stable bubble size may be several inches to a few feet in diameter If a small-diameter column ts used with a deep bed of solids the bubbles may grow until they fill the entire cross section Successive bubbles then travel up the column separated by slugs of solids This is called slugging and is usually undesirable because of pressure fluctuations in the bed increased entrainment and difficulties in scaling up to larger units

182 SECTION 11: Fluid Mechanics When the superficial gas velocity increases to values much above most there is a transition from bubbling fluidization to what is called turbulent fluidization or fast fluidization. The transition occurs when the bed has expanded so much that there can no longer be a dispersed bubble phase The gas phase is continuous and there are small regions of high or low bed density with rapid density fluctuations at all points in the bed The velocity for transition to turbulent fluidization is generally in the range of 0.3 to 0.6 mes i to 2 ft/s), but it is difficult to predict the transition velocity because it depends on the particle properties and the average bubble size At still higher gas velocities all particles fed are rapidly entrained with the gas but they can be recovered with a cyclone and returned to the bottom to maintain solids in the unit This type of system is called a circulating fluid bed even though there is no distinct bed of solids The volume fraction of solids in the suspension is quite low often just a few percent Such a system is quite like an example of pneuma magic transport as discussed later The generalization that liquids give particulate fluidization of solids while gases give bubbling fluidization is not completely valid The density difference is an important parameters and very heavy solids may exhibit bubbling fluidization with water while gases at high pressures may give particulate fluidization of fine solids also fine solids of moderate density such as cracking catalysts may exhibit part stimulate fluidization for a limited range of velocities and then bubbling fluidization at high velocities Expansion of fluidized beds With both types of fluidization the bed expands as the superficial velocity in creases and since the total pressure drop remains constant the pressure drop per unit length decreases as i increases Rearranging end (7.48) gives a i = go - â¬)(pp i i (7.55) Particulate fluidization. For particulate fluidization the expansion is uniform and the run equation which applies to the fixed bed might be expected to hold approximately for the slightly expanded bed Assuming the flow between the part clues is laminar using the first term of end (7.22) leads to the following equation for the expanded beds 3 = me (7.56) 1-â¬ guy ~ pyP3D; Note that this equation is similar to end (7.51) for the minimum fluidization veloce it but now up is the independent variable and i the dependent variable Equation (7.56) predicts that â¬Â°/(1 i i is proportional to to for values greater than boy The expanded bed height may be obtained from i and the values of L and i at incipient fluidization, using the equation Ls my (157) let

For bubbling fluidization, the expansion of the bed comes mainly from the space occupied by gas bubbles since the dense phase does not expand significantly with increasing total flow In the following derivation the gas flow through the dense phase is assumed to be boy times the fraction of the bed occupied by the dense phase and the rest of the gas flow is to be carried by the bubbles thus to = forty + U i for mom (7.59) where fa = fraction of bed occupied by bubbles i = average bubble velocity Since all the solid is in the dense phase the height of the expanded bed times the fraction dense phase must equal the bed height at incipient fluidization my = 11 fry (7.60) Combining else (7.59) and (7.60) gives L my i i a tO (7.61) la in i to When i is much greater than vow the bed expands only slightly even though to may be several times toast An empirical equation for bubble velocity in a fluidized bed is my i 0.7/8 do (7.62) There is only a small effect of particle size or shape on the coefficient in end (7.62). and although large bubbles are mushroom-shaped rather than spherical the equal ton holds quite well with do taken as the equivalent spherical diameter For do = 100 my up is 700 mm/s; and if box = 10 miss and my = 100 mm/s, then lily would be 1.15.

The expansion of the bed is usually in the range of 20 to 50 percent even at velocities up to 50 times Vosj, in contrast to the large expansions found in particle hate fluidization. Some fine powders fluidized with a gas exhibit particulate fluidization over a limited range of velocities near the minimum fluidization point With increasing velocity the bed expands uniformly until bubbles start to form gradually collapses to a minimum height as the velocity is increased past the bubble point and then ex hands again as bubble flow becomes predominant Sitica-alumina cracking catalyst shows this anomalous behavior and bed expansion data for a commercial catalyst are contrasted with those for a fine sand in fig 7.16. The region of particulate flu indication is found only with quite small or low-density particles A classification of solids based on these properties is given by Geldart.? Applications of fluidization Extensive use of fluidization began in the petroleum industry with the develop went of fluidized catalytic cracking Although the industry now generally uses riser or transport-line reactors for catalytic cracking rather than fluid beds the catalyst regeneration is still carried out in fluidized reactors which are as large as 14 m in diameter Fluidization is used in other catalytic processes such as the synthesis of acrylonitrile and for carrying out solid-gas reactions There is much interest in the fluidized-bed combustion of coal as a means of reducing boiler cost and decreasing the emission of pollutants Fluidized beds are also used for roasting ores drying fine solids and adsorption of gases The chief advantages of fluidization are that the solid is vigorously agitated by the fluid passing through the bed and the mixing of the solids ensures that there are practically no temperature gradients in the bed even with quite exothermic or end exothermic reactions The violent motion of the solids also gives high heat-transfer

CHAPTER i Flow Past Immersed Objects 187 rates to the wall or to cooling tubes immersed in the bed Because of the fluidity of the solids it is easy to pass solids from one vessel to another The main disadvantage of gas-solid fluidization is the uneven contacting of gas and solid Most of the gas passes through the bed as bubbles and directly contacts only a small amount of solid in a thin shell known as the bubble cloud around the bubble A small fraction of the gas passes through the dense phase which contains nearly all the solid There is some interchange of gas between the bubbles and the dense phase by diffusion and by turbulent processes such as bubble splitting and coalescence but the overall conversion of a gaseous reactant is generally much less than with uniform contacting at the sane temperature as in an ideal plug-flow reactor In turbulent fluidization the average bed density is lower than in bubbling fluidization, but there is better mass transfer between gas and solids which may improve the performance of the unit as a chemical reactor Even so the scale of fluidized reactors is often uncertain Other disadvantages of fluidized beds more easily dealt with by proper design include erosion of vessel internal parts and attrition of the solids leading to loss of finest Most fluidized reactors have internal or external cyclones to recover finest but filters or scrubbers are often needed also Continuous fluidization; slurry and pneumatic transport When the velocity of the fluid through the solids becomes large enough all the particles are entrained in the fluid and carried along with it to give continuous fluidization. As discussed earlier some gas-solid reactors operate in this fashion but the principal applications of continuous fluidization are in transporting solids from point to point Hydraulic or slurry transport Particles smaller than about 50 him in diameter settle very slowly and are readily suspended in a moving liquid Larger particles are harder to suspend and when the diameter is 0.25 my or greater a fairly large liquid velocity is needed to keep the particles moving especially in horizontal pipes The critical velocity van below which particles will settle out is typically between | and 5 must depending on the density difference between solids and liquid the particle did meters the slurry concentration and the size of the pipe Critical velocities are larger in big pipe than in small pipe A semitheoretical general equation for predict in v has been proposed by Oroskar and Turian.'Â® The pressure drop in flurries of unsettling particles may be found from the equations for a homogeneous liquid with appropriate allowance for the increased density and apparent viscosity For settling flurries there is no single satisfactory correlation the pressure drop in a horizontal pipe is greater than that in a single phase fluid of the same density and viscosity as the slurry especially near the critical velocity but approaches that in the single-phase liquid as the velocity in creases When the velocity is eve or greater the pressure drop in the slurry and that in the equivalent single-phase liquid are equal The velocity in a long slurry pipeline is typically 1,5 to 2 times van Pneumatic conveying The suspending fluid in a pneumatic conveyor is a gas usually air flowing at velocities between 15 and 30 mes in pipes ranging from 50

CHAPTER 8 Transportation and Metering of Fluids Preceding chapters have dealt with theoretical aspects of fluid motion The engineer is concerned also with practical problems in transporting quids from one place to another and in measuring their rates of flow Such problems are the subject of this chapter The first part of the chapter deals with the transportation of fluids both liquids and gases Solids are sometimes handled by similar methods by suspending them in a like did to form a palpable slurry or by conveying them in a high-velocity gas stream It is cheaper to move fluids than solids and materials are transported as fluids whenever possible In operations at close to atmospheric pressure gases are often carried in square or rectangular ducts but under elevated pressures they are carried in pipe or tubing that is circular in cross section The second part of the chapter discusses common methods of measuring the flow rate pipe fittings AND VALVES Pipe and tubing Fluids are usually transported in pipe or tubing which is circular in cross sect ton and available in widely varying sizes wall thicknesses and materials of construction There is no clearcut distinction between the terms pipe and tubing Generally speaking pipe is heavy-walled and relatively large in diameter and comes in moderate lengths of 20 or 40 it i or 12 my tubing is thin-walled and often comes in coils several hundred feet long Metallic pipe can be threaded tubing us ally cannot Pipe walls are usually slightly rough tubing has very smooth walls Lengths of pipe are joined by screwed flanged or welded fittings pieces of tubing are connected by compression fittings flare fittings or soldered fittings finally 194

CHAPTER i Transportation and Metering of Fluids 195 tubing is usually extruded or cold-drawn, while metallic pipe is made by welding casting or piercing a billet in a piercing mill Pipe and tubing are made from many materials including metals and alloys woods ceramics glass and various plastics Polyvinyl chloride or pick pipe is extensively used for wastepaper lines In process plants the most common material is low-carbon steel fabricated into what is sometimes called black-iron pipe Wrought-iron and cast-iron pipes are also used for a number of special purposes sizes Pipe and tubing are specified in terms of their diameter and their wall thickness With steel pipe the standard nominal diameters in us practice range from 5 to 30 in For large pipe more than 12 in in diameter the nominal diameters are the actual outside diameters for small pipe the nominal diameter does not core respond to any actual dimension The nominal value is close to the actual inside did meter for i to 12-in. pipe but for very small pipe this is not true Regardless of wall thickness the outside diameter of all pipe of a given nominal size is the same to ensure interchangeability of fittings Standard dimensions of steel pipe are given in happy 3. Pipe of other materials is also made with the same outside diameters as steel pipe to permit interchanging parts of a piping system These standard sizes for steel pipe therefore are known as is iron pipe size or ups normal pipe size Thus the designation â2-in. nickel is pipe means nickel pipe having the same out side diameter as standard 2-in. steel pipe The want thickness of pipe is indicated by the schedule number which increases with the thickness Ten schedule numbersâ10, 20. 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140. and 160âare in used but with pipe less than 8 in in diameter only numbers 40, 80, 120, and 160 are common In standards for the United Kingdom the nominal size called the in number is expressed in millimeters for example 100, 150. up to 600) and the minimum bore is specified for each nominal size The size of tubing is indicated by the outside diameter The normal value is the actual outer diameter to within very close tolerances Wall thickness is ordinarily given by the big (Birmingham wire gauge number which ranges from 24 very light to 7 very heavy Sizes and wall thicknesses of heat-eXchanger tubing are given in happy 4. Selection of pipe sizes The pipe size selected for a particular installation de pends mainly on the cost of the pipe and fittings and the cost of energy needed for pumping the fluid The cost of the pipe and the annual capital charges increase with about the 1.5 power of the pipe diameter while the power cost for turbulent flow varies with the ~4.8 power of the diameter Equations have been presented giving the optimum pipe diameter as a function of flow rate and fluid density but these can be converted to the optimum velocity which is nearly independent of the flow rate For turbulent flow of liquids in steel pipes larger than | in (25 my in dime term the optimum velocity is - 12m*! opt = of (8.1)

For flow in heat exchanger tubes the optimum design velocity is often higher than that given by egg (8.1) because of improved heat transfer at high fluid velocities When flow is by gravity from overhead tanks or when a viscous liquid is being pumped low velocities are favored in the range of 0.2 to 0.8 it's (0.06 to 0.24 m/s). The relations among pipe size volumetric flow rate and fluid velocity are shown in happy 3. For large complex piping systems the cost of piping may be a substantial face ton of the total investment and elaborate computer methods of optimizing pipe sizes are justified Joints and fittings The methods used to join pieces of pipe or tubing depend in part on the proper ties of the material but primarily on the thickness of the wall Thick-walled tubular products are usually connected by screwed fittings by flanges or by welding Pieces of thin-walled tubing are joined by soldering or by compression or flare filth tings Pipe made of brittle materials such as glass or carbon or cast iron is joined by flanges or bell-and-spigot joints When screwed fittings are used the ends of the pipe are threaded externally with a threading tools The thread is tapered and the few threads farthest from the end of the pipe are imperfect so that a tight joint is formed when the pipe is screwed into a fitting Tape of polytetrafluoroethylene is wrapped around the threaded end to ensure a good seal Threading weakens the pipe wall and the fittings are generally weaker than the pipe itself when screwed fittings are used therefore a higher schedule number is needed than with other types of joints Screwed fittings are stand dardized for pipe sizes up to 12 in (300 mm), but because of the difficulty of thread in and handling large pipe they are rarely used in the field with pipe larger than 3 in.(75 mm). Lengths of pipe larger than about 2 in (50 my are usually connected by flanges or by welding Flanges are matching disks or rings of metal bolted together and compressing a gasket between their faces The flanges themselves are attached to the pipe by screwing them on or by welding or brazing A flange with no opening used to close a pipe is called a blind flange or a blank flange For joining pieces of large steel pipe in process piping especially for high-pressure service welding has become the standard method Welding makes stronger joints than screwed fittings do and since it does not weaken the pipe wall lighter pipe can be used for a given pressure Properly made welded joints are leakproof, whereas other types of joints are not Environmental protection legislation considers flanged and screwed joints to be sources of emission of volatile materials Almost the only disadvantage of a welded joint is that it cannot be opened without de stroking it

CHAPTER i Transportation and Metering of Fluids 197 Allowances for expansion Almost all pipe is subjected to varying temperatures and in some high temperature lines the temperature change is very large Such changes cause the pipe to expand and contract If the pipe is rigidly fixed to its supports it may tear loose bend or even break In large lines therefore fixed supports are not used instead the pipe rests loosely on rollers or is hung from above by chains or rods Provision is also made in all high-temperature lines for taking up expansion so that the fittings and valves are not put under strain This is done by bends or loops in the pipe by packed expansion joints by bellows or backless joints and sometimes by flexible metal hose Prevention of leakage around moving parts In many kinds of processing equipment it is necessary to have one part move in relation to another part without excessive leakage of a fluid around the moving member This is true in packed expansion joints and in valves where the stem must i enter the valve body and be free to turn without allowing the fluid in the valve to escape it is also necessary where the shaft of a pump or compressor enters the casing where an agitator shaft passes through the wall of a pressure vessel and in other similar places Common devices for minimizing leakage while permitting relative motion are stuffing boxes and mechanical seals Neither completely stops leakage but if no leakage whatever of the process fluid can be tolerated it is possible to modify the device to ensure that only innocuous fluids leak into or escape from the equipment The motion of the moving part may be reciprocating or rotational or both together it may be small and occasional as in a packed expansion joint or virtually continue oust as in a process pump Stuffing boxes A stuffing box can provide a seal around a rotating shaft and also around a shaft that moves axially In this it differs from mechanical seals which are good only with rotating members The box is a chamber cut into the stationary member surrounding the shaft or pipe as shown in fig 8.1a. Often a boss is provided on the casing or vessel wall to give a deeper chamber The annular space between the shaft and the wall of the chamber is filled with pecking consisting of a rope or rings of inert material containing a lubricant such as graphite The packing when compressed tightly around the shaft keeps the fluid from passing out through the stuffing box and yet permits the shaft to turn or move back and forth The pack in is compressed by a follower ring or glands pressed into the box by a flanged cap or packing nuts The shaft must have a smooth surface so that it does not wear away the packing even so the pressure of the packing considerably increases the force required to move the shaft A stuffing box even under ideal conditions does not completely stop fluid from leaking out in fact when the box is operating properly there should be small leakage Otherwise the wear on the packing and the power Joss in the lubricated stuffing box are excessive When the fluid is toxic or corrosive means must be provided to prevent it from escaping from the equipment This can be done by using a lantern gland fig 8.1b), which may be looked upon as two stuffing boxes on the same shaft with two sets of

Fluid in the high-pressure zone is kept from leaking out around the shaft by the stationary graphite ring held by springs against the face of the rob taking metal collar Stationary cup packing of rubber or plastic is set in the space between the body of the seal and the chamber holding it around the shaft this keeps fluid from leaking past the nonrotating part of the seal and yet leaves the graphite ring free to move axially so that it can be pressed tightly against the collar Rotary seals require less maintenance than stuffing boxes and have come into wide use in equipment handling highly corrosive fluids Valves A typical processing plant contains thousands of valves of many different sizes and shapes Despite the variety in their design however all valves have a common primary purpose to slow down or stop the flow of a fluid Some valves work best in on-or-off service fully open or fully closed Others are designed to throttle to reduce the pressure and flow rate of a fluid Still others permit flow in one direction only or only under certain conditions of temperature and pressure A steam trap which is a special form of valve allows water and inert gas to pass through while holding back

Gate valves and globe valves The two most common types of valves gate valves and globe valves are illustrated in fig 8.3. In a gate valve the diameter of the opening through which the fluid passes is nearly the same as that of the pipe and the direction of flow does not change As a results a wide-open gate valve introduces only a small pressure drop The disk is tapered and its into a tapered seat when the valve is opened the disk rises into the bonnet completely out of the path of the fluid Gate valves are not recommended for controlling flow and are usually left fully open or fully closed

Suction lift and cavitation The power calculated by end (8.6) depends on the difference in pressure between discharge and suction and is independent of the pressure level From energy considerations it is immaterial whether the suction pressure is below armor sphenic pressure or well above it as long as the fluid remains liquid however if the suction pressure is only slightly greater than the vapor pressure some liquid may flash to vapor inside the pump a process called cavitation which greatly reduces the pump capacity and causes severe erosion If the suction pressure is actually less than the vapor pressure there will be vaporization in the suction line and no liquid can be drawn into the pump To avoid cavitation the pressure at the pump inlet must exceed the vapor press sure by a certain value called the net positive suction head (NPSH), The required value of nosh is about 2 to 3 m i to 10 to for small centrifugal pumps but it increases with pump capacity impeller speed and discharge pressure and values up to 15 m (50 to are recommended for very large pumps For a pump taking suction from a reservoir like that shown in fig 8.5, the available nosh is customarily calculated as . of pa = pa 5 nosh = i i ââââ i for J i z (8.9a) & be or in ups units nosh = we open Pe a azo (8.9b) g p where pa = absolute pressure at surface of reservoir pya = vapor pressure my = friction in suction line The velocity head at the pump inlet a,V2/2 could be subtracted from the result given by end (8.9) to give a more theoretically correct value of the available nosh But this term is usually only about 30 to 60 am j to 2 to and is accounted for in the values of the minimum required net positive suction head (NPSHR) specified by the pump manufacturers Because of the cyclic variations in flow rate the velocity head for more properly in this case the acceleration head may be important in specify in positive-displacement pumps

They can discharge against a pressure of },500 at or more In a diaphragm pump the reciprocating member is a flexible diaphragm of metal plastic or rubber This eliminates the need for packing or seals exposed to the liquid being pumped a great advantage when handling toxic or corrosive liquids Diaphragm pumps handle small to moderate amounts of liquid up to about 100 gal/min, and can develop pressures in excess of 100 at

CHAPTER i Transportation and Metering of Fluids 207 The mechanical efficiency of reciprocating pumps varies from 40 to 50 percent for small pumps to 70 to 90 percent for large ones It is nearly independent of speed within normal operating limits and decreases slightly with an increase in discharge pressure because of added friction and leakage Volumetric efficiency The ratio of the volume of fluid discharged to the volume swept by the piston or plunger is called the volumetric efficiency In positive displacement pumps the volumetric efficiency is nearly constant with increasing discharge pressure although it drops a little because of leakage Because of the con stance of volume flow plunger and diaphragm pumps are widely used as metering pumps injecting liquid into a process system at controlled but adjustable volumetric rates Rotary pumps A wide variety of rotary positive-displacement pumps are available my bear such names as gear pumps lobe pumps screw pumps cam pumps and varve pumps Two examples of gear pumps are shown in fig 8.6. Unlike reciprocating pumps rotary pumps contain no check valves Close tolerances between the moving and stationary parts minimize leakage from the discharge space back to the suction space they also limit the operating speed Rotary pumps operate best on clean mode irately viscous fluids such as light lubricating oil Discharge pressures up to 200 at or more can be attained In the spur-gear pump fig 8.6a) interesting gears rotate with close clear once inside the casing Liquid entering the suction line at the bottom of the casing is caught in the spaces between the teeth and the casing and is carried around to the top of the casing and forced out the discharge Liquid cannot short-circuit back to the suction because of the close meshing of the gears in the center of the pump Discharge .

The liquid enters through a suction connection concentric with the axis of a high-speed rotary element called the impeller which carries radial vanes integrally cast in ill Liquid flows outward in the spaces between the vanes and leaves the impeller at a considerably greater velocity with respect to the ground than at the entrance to the impeller In a properly functioning pump the space between the vanes is completely filled with liquid flowing without cavitation The liquid Discharge : Volute Wearing ring Stuffing box a | | | C Oo a Inlet i all i to Y we Ay to we fie / A we p it tire FIGURE 8.7 Single-suction centrifugal pump

CHAPTER i Transportation and Metering of Fluids 209 leaving the outer periphery of the impeller is collected in a spiral casing called the volute and leaves the pump through a tangential discharge connection In the volute the velocity head of the liquid from the impeller is converted to pressure head The power is applied to the fluid by the impeller and is transmitted to the imp teller by the torque of the driveshaft which usually is driven by a direct-connected motor at constant speed commonly at 1,750 or 3,450 remind Under ideal conditions of frictionless flow the mechanical efficiency of a cent tribunal pump is of course 100 percent and = 1. An ideal pump operating at a given speed delivers a definite discharge rate at each specific developed head Actual pumps because of friction and other departures from perfection fall consider drably short of the ideal case Centrifugal pumps constitute the most common type of pumping machinery in ordinary plant practice They come in a number of types other than the simple volute machine shown in fig 8.7. A common type uses a double-stetion impeller which accepts liquid from both sides The impeller itself may be a simple open spider or it may be enclosed or shrouded handbooks texts on pumps and expel really the catalogs of pump manufacturers show many types sizes and designs of centrifugal pumps Centrifugal pump theory Except in very small pumps the impeller vanes are not truly radial but are curved backwards opposite to the direction of rotation as shown in figs 8.8 and 8.9.

226 section 11: Fluid Mechanics In the upstream cone the fluid velocity is increased and its pressure decreased The pressure drop in this cone is used to measure the flow rate In the discharge cone the velocity is decreased and the original pressure largely recovered The angle of the discharge cone is made small between i and 15Â°, to prevent bound are layer separation and to minimize friction Since there is no separation in a contracting cross section the upstream cone can be made shorter than the down stream cone Typically 90 percent of the pressure boss in the upstream cone is recovered Although venture meters can be applied to the measurement of gas flow rates they are most commonly used with liquids especially large flows of water where because of the large pressure recovery a venture requires less power than other types of meters The basic equation for a venture meter is obtained by writing the Bernoulli equation for incompressible fluids across the upstream cone If v and v are the average upstream and downstream velocities respectively and p is the density of the fluid end (4.74) becomes - i spa i pro ay v ~a,V2 = Pe to (8.22) p The continuity relation (4.14) can be written since the density is constant as 2 - my i - - v i v = be (8.23) do where do = diameter of pipe do = diameter of throat of meter B = diameter ratio D,/D, If van is eliminated from else (8.22) and (8.23), the result is 5 1 2(Pu > pro my = we | pop (8.24) say i bra p venture coefficient Equation (8.24) applies strictly to the frictionless flow of incompressible fluids To account for the small friction loss between locations i and be end (8.24) is corrected by introducing an empirical factor c and writing - my i up i pop my = we | (8.25) all B p The small effects of the kinetic energy factors a and a are also taken into account in the definition of can The coefficient c is determined experimentally It is called the venture coefficient velocity of approach not included The effect of the approach velocity v is accounted for by the term 1/1 i 81.

It consists of an accuse rarely machined and drilled plate mounted between two flanges with the hole con centric with the pipe in which it is mounted (Off-center or segmental openings are also used on occasion The opening in the plate may be beveled on the down stream side Pressure taps one above and one below the orifice plate are installed and are connected to a manometer or differential pressure transmitter The posit tons of the taps are arbitrary and the coefficient of the meter will depend upon the position of the taps Three of the recognized methods of placing the taps are shown in Table 8.2. Flange taps are the most common The taps shown in fig 8.17 are vena contract taps The principle of the orifice meter is identical with that of the venture The reduction of the cross section of the flowing stream in passing through the orifice increases the velocity head at the expense of the pressure head and the reduction in pressure between the taps is measured by the manometer Bernoulli's equation provides a basis for correlating the increase in velocity head with the decrease in pressure head

The jet is not under the control of solid walls as is the case in the venture and the area of the jet varies from that of the opening in the orifice to that of the vena contract The area at any given point for example at the downstream tape is not easily deter minable and the velocity of the jet at the downstream tap is not easily related to the diameter of the orifice Orifice coefficients are smaller and more variable than those for the venture and the quantitative treatment of the orifice meter is movie find accordingly

CHAPTER i Transportation and Metering of Fluids 229 Extensive and detailed design standards for orifice meters are available in the literature They must be followed if the performance of a meter is to be predicted accurately without calibration For approximate or preliminary design however it is satisfactory to use an equation similar to end (8.25) as follows my = we i Pod (8.28) vibe up where my = velocity through orifice B = ratio of orifice diameter to pipe diameter to my = pressures at stations a and b in fig 8.17 In end (8.28), c is the orifice coefficient velocity of approach not included it corrects for the contraction of the fluid jet between the orifice and the vena con lactam for friction and for a and a Coefficient can is always determined expert mentally it varies considerably with changes in 6 and with refolds number at the orifice Re,,.

(8.29) we and the where do is the orifice diameter Equation (8.28) is useful for design because c is almost constant and indecent dent of B provided red is greater than about 30,000. Under these conditions c may be taken as 0.61 for both flange taps and vena contract taps For process applications 8 should be between 0.20 and 0.75. If 8 is less than 0.25, the term v i i differs negligibly from unity Equations (8.26) and (8.27) for venture me tears may be used for orifice meters by substituting c for can up for van and S,,. the cross-sectional area of the orifice for S,,. It is especially important that enough straight pipe be provided both upstream and downstream of the orifice to ensure a flow pattern that is normal and unwise turned by fittings valves or other equipment Otherwise the velocity distribution will not be normal and the orifice coefficient will be affected in an unpredictable manner Data are available for the minimum length of straight pipe that should be provided upstream and downstream of the orifice to ensure normal velocity district bution.â Straightening vanes in the approach line may be used if the required length of pipe ts not available upstream of the orifice Pressure recovery Because of the large friction losses from the eddies generated by the expanding jet below the vena contract the pressure recovery in an orifice meter is poor The resulting power loss is one disadvantage of the orifice meters The fraction of the orifice differential that is permanently lost depends on the value of fa and the relationship between the fractional loss and # is shown in fig 8.18. For a value of 8 of 0.5. the lost head is about 73 percent of the orifice differential The pressure difference measured by pipe taps where the downstream tap is eight pipe diameters below the orifice is really a measurement of permanent loss rather than of the orifice differential

They are relax lively expensive devices but their accuracy is high approximately +0.5 percent of the measured rate and they can measure flow rates of hard-to-handle fluids such as liquids containing solid particles or undissolved gases or gases carrying drops of condensate The flow coefficient is about 0.8: unlike that of orifice meters it is es mentally constant at low flow rates down to refolds numbers as low as 500. Area meters octameters In the orifice nozzle or venture the variation of flow rate through a constant area generates a variable pressure drop which is related to the flow rate Another class of meters called area meters consists of devices in which the pressure drop is constant or nearly so and the area through which the fluid flows varies with the flow rate The area is related through proper calibration to the flow rate The most important area meter is the rotamerer, which is shown in fig 8.20. It consists essentially of a gradually tapered glass tube mounted vertically in a frame with the large end up The fluid flows upward through the tapered tube and suspends freely a float which actually does not float but is completely submerged in the fluid The float is the indicating elements and the greater the flow rate the higher the float rides in the tube The entire fluid stream must flow through the annular space between the float and the tube wall The tube is marked in divisions and the meter is read from the scale reading at the edge of the float octameters are used for both liquid and gas flow measurements The bore of the tube is either a plain conical taper or a taper with three beads or flutes parallel with the axis of the tube The tube shown in fig 8.20 is a tapered tube The float may be any one of a variety of shapes that shown in fig 8.20 is type call For small flows the float is often spherical For use with opaque liquids for high temperatures or pressures or for other conditions where glass is impracticable metal tubes are used Metal tubes are plain tapered Since in a metal tube the float is invisible means must be provided for either indicating or transmitting the meter reading This is accomplished by attaching a rode called an extension to the top or bottom of the float and using the extension as an armature The extension is end closed in a Auid-tight the mounted on one of the fittings Since the inside of this tube communicates directly with the interior of the rotameter. no stuffing box for the extension is needed The tube is surrounded by external induction coils The length of the extension exposed to the coils varies with the position of the float This in turn

CHAPTER i Transportation and Metering of Fluids 237 Dual-tube orioles meters are highly accurate and directly measure the mass flow rate Used mostly with small pipes they are costly to install and operate con sequently their applications are generally limited to difficult fluids or to situations in which their high accuracy justifies their higher cost A simpler type of orioles meter uses a single straight tube fixed at both ends which is made to vibrate by a force applied at the middle of the tube Insertion Meters In this type of meter the sensing elements which is small compared to the size of the flow channel is inserted into the Now stream A few insertion meters measure the average flow velocity but the majority measure the local velocity at one point only The positioning of the sensing clement is therefore important if the total flow rate is to be determined The local measured velocity must bear a constant and known relationship to the average velocity of the fluid The point of measurement may be at the centering of the channel and the avo erase velocity may be found from the ratio of the average to the maximum velocity see chap 5.) alternatively the sensor may be located at the critical point in the channel where the local velocity equals the average velocity In either case precast tons must be taken usually by providing long calming sections upstream of the meters to ensure that the velocity profile is fully developed and not distorted pilot tube The pilot tube is a device used to measure the local velocity along a streamlined The principle of the device is shown in fig 8.25.

It is nearly unity in well-designed pilot tubes The disadvantages of the pilot tube are (1) that most designs do not give the avo erase velocity directly and (2) that its readings for gases are extremely small When it's used for measuring low-pressure gases some form of multiplying gauge like that shown in fig 2.4, must also be used EXAMPLE 8.5.

CHAPTER 9 Agitation and Mixing of Liquids Many processing operations depend for their success on the effective agitation and mixing of fluids Though often confused agitation and mixing are not synonymous Agitation refers to the induced motion of a material in a specified way usually in a circulatory pattern inside some sort of container Mixing is the random distribution into and through one another of two or more initially separate phases A single how momentous material such as a tankful of cold water can be agitated but it cannot be mixed until some other material such as a quantity of hot water or some pow dared solid is added to it The term mixing is applied to a variety of operations differing widely in the de gree of homogeneity of the mixed material consider in one case two gases that are brought together and thoroughly blended and in a second case sand gravel cement and water tumbled in a rotating drum for a long time In both cases the final product is said to be mixed Yet the products are obviously not equally homogeneous Samples of the mixed gasesâeven very small samplesâall have the same composition Small samples of the mixed concrete on the other hands differ widely in composition This chapter deals with the agitation and mixing of liquids the dispersion of liquids and gases into other liquids and the suspension of solids in liquids Mixing of stiff pastes elastomers and dry solid powders is discussed in chap 28. Purposes of agitation Liquids are agitated for a number of purposes depending on the objectives of the processing step These purposes include 1. Suspending solid particles 2. Blending miscible liquids for example methyl alcohol and water 3. Dispersing a gas through the liquid in the form of small bubbles 4. Dispersing a second liquid immiscible with the first to form an emulsion or a suspension of fine drops 5. Promoting heat transfer between the liquid and a coil or jacket 244

CHAPTER i Agitation and Mixing of Liquids 245 Often one agitator serves several purposes at the same time as in the catalytic hydrogenation of a liquid In a hydrogenation vessel the hydrogen gas is dispersed through the liquid in which solid particles of catalyst are suspended promoting mass transfer between the liquid and suspended particles The heat of reaction is simultaneously removed by a cooling coil or jacket Heat transfer in agitated vessels is discussed in chap 15; mass transfer to drops bubbles and solid particles in chap 17. AGITATED VESSELS Liquids are most often agitated in some kind of tank or vessel usually cylindrical in form and with a vertical axis The top of the vessel may be open to the air more us ally it's closed The proportions of the tank vary widely depending on the nature of the agitation problem A standardized design such as that shown in fig 9.1, how ever is applicable in many situations The tank bottom is rounded not flat to climb inmate sharp corners or regions into which fluid currents would not penetrate The like did depth is approximately equal to the diameter of the tank An impeller is mounted on an overhung shaft that is a shaft supported from above The shaft is driven by a motor sometimes directly connected to the shaft but more often connected to it through a speed-reducing gearbox Accessories such as inlet and outlet lines coils jackets and wells for thermometers or other temperature-measuring devices are usually included FIGURE 9.1 Motor Typical agitation process vessel ââ, of Speed reducer us in i a Liquid surface Dip leg i I Thermowell Jacket i Shaft Baffle it ya Impeller a 2 . a Drain valve KS 7?~

246 SECTION i Fluid Mechanics The impeller causes the liquid to circulate through the vessel and eventually red turn to the impeller Baffles are often included to reduce tangential motion The flow patterns in agitated vessels are discussed in detail later in this chapter Impellers Impeller agitators are divided into two classes Those that generate currents parallel with the axis of the impeller shaft are called axial-flow impellers those that generate currents in a radial or tangential direction are called radial-flow impellers The three main types of impeller for low to moderate-viscosity liquids are pro pellets turbines and high-efficiency impellers Each type includes many variations and subtypes which are not considered here For very viscous liquids the most widely used impellers are helical impellers and anchor agitators propellers A propeller is an axial-flow, high-speed impeller for liquids of low viscosity Small propellers turn at full motor speed either 1,150 or 1,750 rum larger ones turn at 400 to 800 rum The direction of rotation is usually chosen to force the liquid downward and the flow currents leaving the impeller continue until deflected by the floor of the vessel The highly turbulent swirling column of liquid leaving the impeller entrains stagnant liquid as it moves along and the propeller blades vigor only cut or shear the liquid Because of the persistence of the flow currents pro teller agitators are effective in very large vessels A revolving propeller traces out a helix in the fluid and if there were no slip be tween liquid and propeller one full revolution would move the liquid longitudinally a fixed distance depending on the angle of inclination of the propeller blades The ratio of this distance to the propeller diameter is known as the pitch of the propeller A propeller with a pitch of 1.0 is said to have square pitch A typical propeller is illustrated in fig 9.2@. Standard three-blade marine pro pellets with square pitch are most common four-blade, toothed and other designs are sometimes employed for special purposes Propellers rarely exceed 18 in in diameter regardless of the size of the vessel In a deep tank two or more propellers may be mounted on the same shaft usually directing the liquid in the same direction turbines Four types of turbine impeller are illustrated in fig 9.2. The simple straight-blade turbine shown in fig 9.26 pushes the liquid radially and tangentially with almost no vertical motion at the impeller The currents it generates travel out ward to the vessel wall and then flow either upward or downward Such impellers are sometimes called paddles In process vessels they typically turn at 20 to 150. remind The disk turbine with multiple straight blades mounted on a horizontal disk fig 9.2c), creates zones of high shear rate it is especially useful for dispersing a gas in a liquid because at moderate speeds the gas is forced to flow radially to the blade tips where it is dispersed by the high shear Also widely used for gas dispersion is the concave-blade CD-6 disk turbine shown in fig 9.2d. A pitched-blade turbine fig 9.2e) is used when good overall circulation is important because it provides some axial flow in addition to the radial flow

To provide good agitation near the floor of the tank an anchor impeller fig 9.55) may be used Because it creates no vertical motion it is a less effective mixer than a helical ribbon but it promotes good heat transfer to or from the vessel wall For this purpose both anchors and helical ribbons may be equipped with scrap ears that physically remove liquid from the tank wall Flow patterns The way a liquid moves in an agitated vessel depends on many things the type of impeller the characteristics of the liquid especially its viscosity and the size and proportions of the tank baffles and impeller The liquid velocity at any point in the tank has three components and the overall flow pattern in the tank depends on the variations in these three velocity components from point to point The first velocity component is radial and acts in a direction perpendicular to the shaft of the impeller The second component is longitudinal and acts in a direction parallel with the shaft The third component is tangential or rotational and acts in a direction tangent to a circular path around the shaft In the usual case of a vertical shaft the radial and tank genital components are in a horizontal plane and the longitudinal component is very call The radial and longitudinal components are useful and provide the flow nicest say for the mixing action When the shaft is vertical and centrally located in the tank the tangential component is generally disadvantageous The tangential flow follows a circular path around the shaft and creates a vortex in the liquid as shown in fig 9.6 for a flat-blade turbine Exactly the same flow pattern would be observed with a pitched-blade turbine or a propeller The swirling perpetuates stratification at the

The shaft is moved away from the centering of the tank then tilted in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the move In larger tanks the agitator may be mounted in the side of the tank with the shaft in a horizontal plane but at an angle with a radius In large tanks with vertical agitators the preferable method of reducing swirling ts to install baffles which impede rotational flow without interfering with radial or longitudinal flow A simple and effective baffling is attained by installing vertical strips perpendicular to the wail of the tank baffles of this type are shown in fig 9.1. Except in very large tanks four baffles are sufficient to prevent swirling and vortex formation Even one or two baffles if more cannot be used have a strong effect on the circulation patterns For turbines the width of the baffle need be no more than one-twelfth of the vessel diameter for propellers no more than one eighteenth the tank diameter is needed For viscous liquids even narrower baffles are generally used and baffles are not needed at all when x > ja Pa - so Baffles are also not needed with side-entering, inclined or off-center propellers

Draft tubes add to the fluid friction in the system and for a given power input they reduce the rate of flow so they are not used unless they are required Circulation rates For a processing vessel to be effective regardless of the nature of the agitation problem the volume of fluid circulated by the impeller must be great enough to sweep out the entire vessel in a reasonable time also the velocity of the stream leaving the impeller must be sufficient to carry the currents to the remotest parts of the tank In mixing and dispersion operations the circulation rate is not the only factory or even the most important one turbulence in the moving stream often got ears the effectiveness of the operation Turbulence results from properly directed currents and large velocity gradients in the liquid Circulation and turbulence gene ration both consume energy the relations between power input and the design parameters of agitated vessels are discussed later Some agitation problems as will be shown call for large flows or high average velocities while others require high local turbulence or power dissipation Although both flow rate and power dissipate ton increase with stirrer speed selection of the type and size of the impeller in fences the relative values of flow rate and power dissipation In general large impellers moving at medium speed are used to promote flow and smaller imp pellets operating at high speed are used where intense turbulence is required Flow number A turbine or propeller agitator is in essence a pump impeller ops eating without a casing and with undirected inlet and output flows The governing

The velocity gradients in an agitated vessel vary widely from one point to and other in the fluid The gradient equals AV/Ay, as illustrated in fig 9.10. It is quite large near the edge of the jet leaving the impeller since the velocity is high and the jet is relatively narrow Based on the vertical velocity profiles at the blade tip the velocity gradient at this point is approximately 0.9u/0.75W, where 0.9u is the resultant of the radial and tangential velocities and 0.75 W is one-half the width of the jet leaving the impeller Since u = we and we D,,/S5 for a standard turbine this corresponds to a velocity gradient of 19n, which can serve as an estimate of the maximum shear rate in the region near a turbine impeller As the jet travels away from the impeller it slows down and the velocity gradient at the edge of the jet diminishes Behind the turbine blades there are intense vortices where the local shear rate may be as high as 50n."* Figure 9.12 shows the fluid currents observed with a six-blade turbine 6 in in diameter turning at 200 remain in a 12-in. vessel containing cold water.** The plane of observation passes through the axis of the impeller shaft and immediately in front of a radial baffled Fluid leaves the impeller in a radial direction separates into on gitudinal streams flowing upward or downward over the baffled flows inward to ward the impeller shaft and ultimately returns to the impeller intake At the bottom of the vessel immediately under the shaft the fluid moves in a swirling motion elsewhere the currents are primarily radial or longitudinal The numbers in fig 9.12 indicate the scalar magnitude of the fluid velocity at various points as fractions of the velocity of the tip of the impeller blades Under the Baffle Surface of liquid FIGURE 9.12 i | Velocity patterns in turbine agitators \ J we Shot after garrison et all 0 or in 0.2 } does 0 i of i i / | 1 0.25) | on 0.4 real of to 2. 0.25 05â 4 Vessel wall i | for | i a Pee it 5 I 0.25 will Nae i

BLENDING AND MIXING Mixing is a much more difficult operation to study and describe than agitation The patterns of fluid flow and velocity in an agitated vessel are complex but reasonably definite and reproducible The power consumption is readily measured The results of mixing studies on the other hands are seldom highly reproducible and depend in large measure on how mixing is defined by the particular experimenter Often the criterion for good mixing is visual as in the use of interference phenomena to folk low the blending of gases in a duct or the color change of an acid-base indicator to determine liquid blending times.'â*Â° Other criteria that have been used include the rate of decay of concentration or temperature fluctuations the variation in the analyses of small samples taken at random from various parts of the mix the rate of transfer of a solute from one liquid phase to another and in solid-liquid mixtures the visually observed uniformity of the suspension Blending of miscible liquids Miscible liquids are blended in relatively small process vessels by propellers turbines or high-efficiency impellers usually centrally mounted and in large storage and waste treatment tanks by side-entering propellers or jet mixers In a process vessel all the liquid is usually well agitated and blending is fairly rapid In a large storage tank the agitator may be idle much of the time and be turned on only

The mixing times are appreciably greater when the refolds numbers are in the range of 10 to 1,000, even though the power consumption is not much different than for the turbulent range As shown in fig 9.16, the mixing time using baffled turbines varies with about the âJ.5 power of the stirrer speed in this region and then increases more steeply as the refolds number is reduced still further The data in fig 9.16 are for certain ratios of impeller size to tank size A general correlation given by wormwood and Metzner* for turbines is shown in fig 9.17.

oh SECTION it Fluid Mechanics Consequently high-efficiency impellers are usually operated at higher speeds and with higher D,/D, ratios than turbines At the same power input per unit volume mixing is slightly faster than with turbines in the turbulent mixing regime A helical ribbon agitator gives much shorter mixing times for the same power input with very viscous liquids but is slower than the turbine with thin liquids The mixing times for propellers seem high by comparison with turbines but of course the power consumption is more than an order of magnitude lower at the same stirrer speed The propeller data in fig 9.16 were taken from a general correlation of Fox and Gex.â whose mixing me function differs from both else (9.30) and (9.31): i tr(nDiy"g'Â® i (BN'P i i 3 in up i (7) (sn) O29) Their data were for D,/D, of 0.07 to 0.18; the extrapolation to D,/D, = 5 for fig 9.16 is somewhat uncertain Because a vortex often forms in an baffled vest see the inclusion of the proud number in end (9.33) is probably justified In a pseudoplastic liquid blending times at refolds numbers below about 1,000 are much longer than in newtonian liquids under the same impeller condo tons '*? In the regions of low shear far from the impeller the apparent viscosity of the pseudoplastic liquid is greater than it is near the impeller In these remote red lions turbulent eddies decay rapidly and zones of almost stagnant liquid are often formed Both effects lead to poor mixing and long blending times An axial-flow impeller with a draft tube can be used to promote good circulation throughout the vessel At high refolds numbers there is little difference in the mixing character stick of newtonian and pseudoplastic liquids When gas bubbles liquid drops or solid particles are dispersed in a liquid the blending time for the continuous phase is increased even if the comparison is made at the same specific power input's The effect increases with viscosity and for visa cops liquids the blending time can be up to twice the normal value when the gas holdup is only 10 percent EXAMPLE 9.3.

More elements are needed for very viscous liquids because of the lower molecular diffusivity The pressure drop per unit length is about 6 times that in the empty pipe when Re < 10, but increases to about 50 to 100 times that in the empty pipe when Re i 2,000." Another type of static mixer used for gases and low-viscosity liquids is the turn blent vortex mixer shown in fig 9.19b. Each element of this mixer has four tabs protruding at an angle into the pipe Counterrotating longitudinal vortices are formed in the wakes of the tabs providing efficient blending of the liquids or gases after only two to four elements The pressure drop per unit length is 25 to 40 goes the value for the empty pipe at Re = 10* to 10Â°, but since only a few elements are needed the overall pressure drop is not large

Keep in mind that these correlations give the minimum agitation condition for suspension and that requirements for dispersion of a gas or good heat transfer to a coil or jacket may indicate higher power inputs for some cases The ease with which solids are suspended in a liquid depends on the physical properties of the particles and the liquid and on the circulation patterns in the tank The terminal velocity of free-settling particles can be calculated by using the drag coefficient curve fig 7.3), as shown previously It is more difficult to suspend part titles that have a high settling velocity but there is no simple correlation between this velocity and a characteristic velocity in the tank such as the tip speed of the impeller The limiting factor is the liquid velocity near the bottom where the flow is almost horizontal and to get complete suspension the velocity in this region is gene really many times the settling velocity Since it is difficult to measure or predict the velocity distribution investigators have generally measured the critical stirrer speed for complete suspension and developed empirical equations for different agitators ZwieteringâsÂ® correlation is based on data for five types of impellers in six tanks from 6 in to 2 it in diameter The critical stirrer speed is given by the dime sinless equation 0.45 n do a so pi (Â«22 ) be (9.35)

Note that for the same impeller size ratio and clearance ration the critical speed is about the same for the standard turbine and the flat paddle and S for the propeller is slightly lower however because of the large differences in the power number not the turbine takes about twice as much power as the paddle and 15 to 20 times as much power as the propeller to achieve complete suspension of solids With the turbine in normal position slightly less than one-half of the flow produced by the impeller goes down at the wall see fig 9.12), and the average velocity along the bottom of the tank is relatively low The total flow produced by a propeller of the same size is not quite as great but it is all directed downward giving higher velocities and higher shear rates near the bottom If the only purpose of the stirrer is to suspend solids a propeller or other avial-flow impeller such as pitched-blade turbine would be chosen rather than a radial-low impeller however a standard turbine may be needed for good gas dish person or to get higher shear and then correlations such as end (9.35) could be used in checking conditions needed for solid suspension The positive exponent for viscosity in end (9.35) is questionable since the term final velocity is lower in more viscous fluids and viscosity was not varied index , prudently in Zwieteringâs tests Other studiesâ¢ââ have shown a slight decrease in the critical speed as the viscosity was increased A theoretical equation for stirrer speed by Wichterleââ predicts that the exponents for viscosity particle size and density difference all change with particle size and may even change sign His model is based on comparing the particle terminal velocity and the product of particle size TABLE 9.4 Shape factor S in end (9.35) for critical stirrer speed Impeller type did DIE s Six-blade turbine 2 4 4.1 D{W=5 3 4 75 no = 6.2 4 4 is twayblade paddle 2 4 AS dewan 3 4 8 my =2.5 4 4 128 Three-blade propeller 3 4 is no = 0.5 4 4 8.5 4 2.5 95

Power consumption In discussing scale procedures all workers report that lower stirrer speeds are needed to suspend solids in larger tanks if geometric similarity is maintained how ever small differences in the exponents for do in the equation for z can lead to large differences in power requirements since the power per unit volume put varies with no do Some data for suspending sand in water using 45Â° pitched-blade turbines (downward-pumping) are given in fig 9.20.

An ultrasound copper meter was used to measure velocity near the bottom and a transition in the velocity marked complete suspension These tests showed that no varied with D7*/* and that put was index pendent of do The more negative exponents for do in other studies were attributed to incorrect scaling of the stirrer blade thickness The strongest dependence of put on do and the highest power consumptions were reported by coolly and winter who recommended applying constant torque per unit volume which is equivalent to making and constant and put proportional to do's however they did not measure the minimum stirrer speed but only showed that their criterion red to nearly uniform suspension in each tank The power required for uniform suspension is greater than for complete off-bottom suss pension and the ratio is greater for small tank sizes barman found nearly homo generous suspension at 1.27, in 14-ft tank but 1.91, was needed for comparable uniformity in the 1.5-ft tank If satisfactory suspension is obtained in a small tank whether judged by visual over actions particle velocities or mass-transfer rates the safe scale rule is to keep geometric similarity and constant power per unit volume The ratios D,/D, = t and end = i are often recommended though some prefer D,/D, = 0.4 for solids suspension The critical speed can be reduced by decreasing the clearance but it may be hard to start the stirrer if it is in a layer of solids very near the bottom EXAMPLE 9.4.

CHAPTER i Agitation and Mixing of Liquids 281 When a gas is dispersed into a pure liquid in a stirred tank small bubbles are formed in the high-shear region near the tip of the impeller but they coalesce rapidly in low-shear regions away from the impeller The average bubble size for air in water is usually in the range of 2 to 5 my much greater than that given by end (9.4) for liquid-liquid dispersions The interfacial area @ which is more imp portent than the average size increases with a fractional power of the energy diss nation rate and the superficial velocity and it's greater for systems with low intern facial tension Many equations of the following type have been proposed but there is no consensus on the exponents and constants and end (9.45) is intended to show just the approximate effect of those variables C(P/VyPtyes a a (9.45) In electrolyte solutions in multicomponent nontoxic solutions and in solus tons with even a small amount of surface-active impurity coalescence of bub blew may be greatly retarded The average bubble size in a stirred tank is then smaller than that with pure liquids and the difference in surface area may be see eralfold. For particular systems such as air with solutions of sodium sulfite core relations similar to end (9.45) have been presented but there is no satisfactory general correlation Experimental data should be obtained for each new system and equations such as end (9.45) used to guide scaleup. Some generalizations that can be made are that the effects of put and v with coalescing systems are greater than with pure liquids and that the area at a given power dissipation rate is about the same whether a single gas inlet pipe a sparger or a sintered disk is used to introduce the gas Effect of gas flow on power consumption The power consumed by a turbine impeller dispersing a gas is less than that indicated by fig 9.13 for agitating liquids only The ratio of the power required when gas is present to that for the liquid alone depends mainly on the superficial gas velocity and to some extent on the impeller speed tank size impeller design and diameter and the properties of the liquid.** Some data for dispersing air in water with standard six-blade turbines D,./D, = t are shown in fig 9.21. The relative power P,/P, drops rapidly to about 0.5 or 0.6 at velocity of 10 miss and then decreases slowly to Jess than 0.3 at velocity of 00 minds The work of Pharamond et all showed that relative power is almost independent of stirrer speed in the low-velocity region where P,/P,) > 0.5.

The main effect of using a larger impeller is that greater volumes of gas can be dispersed at a given stirrer speed Results for relative power consumption have often been presented as a function of a dimensionless aeration number nap = gun do where qi is the total gas flow and and is a measure of the flow rate of liquid from the impeller The data in fig 9.21 are replotted in this form in fig 9.22. The curves in fig 9.22 are more widely spread because increasing not by increasing the gas flow qi leads to lower values of P,/P,, but increasing not by decreasing the impeller speed n has the opposite effect This type of plot permits the inclusion of published data for which values of #7, do and v are not available The dashed line in fig 9.22 is for the CD-6 impeller which has six strongly curved blades with the concave side forward The test conditions were not specified but the CD-6 impeller clearly gives a smaller drop in power consumption on gassing than do standard turbines The data shown in figs 9.21 and 9.22 are for air and water but can be used for other systems if the change in physical properties is not very great A fourfold increase in viscosity and a 40 percent reduction in surface tension had no significant effect on P,/P,. but the relative power was 10 to 20 percent lower with an Na.SO, solution in which the bubbles were smaller because of reduced coalescence.7! The decrease in power with gassing is not just an effect of the lower average density of the gas-liquid dispersion since the gas holdup is generally 10 percent or less when P,/P, is reduced to 0.5. The decrease in power is associated with the formation of gas pockets behind the turbine blades.*â Bubbles are captured in the centrifugal field of vortices that form behind the horizontal edges of the blades and coalescence leads to large cavities that interfere with normal liquid flow

The change in power dissipation with gassing must be allowed for in the design of large units An agitator drive chosen to handle the torque for a gassed system could be overloaded if the system has to operate occasionally with no gas flow and a dual-speed drive might be needed also good performance sometimes requires constant power dissipation per unit volume and scale may lead to different values of v and P,/Py. Gas-handling capacity and flooding of turbine impellers of the gas throughput . to a turbine-agitated vessel is progressively increased the impeller eventually floods and can no longer disperse the gas effectively The hooding point is not as distinct a transition as in a packed column and various criteria for flooding have been proposed One definition of flooding based on visual inspection is that it och curs when most of the bubbles rise vertically between the turbine blades rather than being dispersed radially from the tips of the blades.'* The critical gas velocity for this transition van was found to be proportional to the power per unit volume diss hated by the stirrer with a slight effect of tank size From data for tanks 1.54 and 0.29 m in diameter and velocities up to 75 mm/s, the following dimensional equal ton was obtained .

AGITATOR SELECTION AND scale Mixer selection There is not necessarily any direct relation between power consumed and the amount or degree of mixing When a low-viscosity liquid is swirled about in an uni baffled vessel the particles may follow circular paths indefinitely and mix little or not at all Almost none of the energy supplied is used for mixing If baffles are added mixing becomes rapid a larger fraction of the energy is used for mixing and relatively less for circulation When the mixing time is critical the best mixer is the one that mixes in the red squired time with the smallest amount of power In many cases a short mixing time is desirable but not essential and the mixing time is a compromise arrived at by consider bring the energy cost for mixing and the capital cost of the mixer For mixing reagents in feed tank or blending product from different batches in a storage tank a relatively small mixer might be used even if several minutes are required for complete mixing scale A major problem in agitator design is to scale up from a laboratory or pilot plant agitator to a full-scale unit The scale of vessels for suspending solids has
Page 302:
CHAPTER i Agitation and Mixing of Liquids 285 already been discussed For some other problems generalized correlations such as those shown in figs 9.13 to 9.17 are available for scaleup. For many other probe less adequate correlations are not available for these situations various methods of scale have been proposed all based on geometric similarity between the labor try and plant equipment It is not always possible however to have the large and small vessels geometrically similar furthermore even if geometric similarity is obi trainable dynamic similarity and kinematic similarity are not so that the results of the scale are not always fully predictable As in most engineering problems the designer must rely on judgment and experience Power consumption in large vessels can be accurately predicted from curves of no versus red as shown in figs 9.13 and 9.14. Such curves may be available in the published literature or they may be developed from pilot-plant studies using small vessels of the proposed design With low-viscosity liquids the amount of power consumed by the impeller per unit volume of quid has been used as a measure of mixing effectiveness based on the reasoning that increased amounts of power mean higher degree of turbulence and a higher degree of turbulence means better mixing Studies have shown this to be at least roughly true In a given mixer the amount of power consumed can be directly related to the rate of solution of a gas or the rate of certain reactions such as oxidation that depend on the intimacy of contact of one phase with another In a rough qualitative way it may be said that } to | he per 1.000 gal of thin liquid gives mild agitation 2 to 3 he per 1,000 gal gives vigor oust agitation and 4 to 10 he per 1,000 gal gives intense agitation These figures refer to the power that is actually delivered to the liquid and do not include power used in driving gear reduction units or in turning the agitator shaft in bearings and stuffing boxes The agitator designed in Example 9.3 would require about 14 he per 1,000 gal of liquid and should provide rather mild agitation note that 5 he per 1,000 gal is equivalent to 1.0 kW/mâ) The optimum ratio of impeller diameter to vessel diameter for a given power input is an important factor in scaleup. The nature of the agitation problem strongly influences this ration For some purposes the impeller should be small relative to the size of the vessel for others it should be large For dispersing a gas in liquid for ex ample the optimum ration is about 0.25; for bringing two immiscible liquids into contact as in liquid-liquid extraction vessels the optimum ration is 0.40. For some blending operations the ratio should be 0.6 or even more In any given operation since the power inputs kept constant the smaller the impeller the higher the impeller speed In general operations that depend on large velocity gradients rather than on high circulation rates are best accomplished by small high-speed impellers as is the case in the dispersion of gases For operations that depend on high circulation rates rather than steep velocity gradients a large slow-moving impeller should be used When constant power per unit volume and geometric similarity are maintained in scaling up the impeller speed changes with D;*/*, as shown below The terms inside the square brackets are all constant so i do must be constant The power per unit volume is a New dip = we (2) (3) we (9.49) to (a/A)DPH 7 do H

CHAPTER i Agitation and Mixing of Liquids 287 Although it is impractical to achieve the same blending time in the full-scale unit as in the pilot-plant vessel a moderate increase in blending time in the larger vessel reduces the power requirement to a reasonable level Such tradeoffs are often necessary in scaling up agitation equipment scale of non-newtonian liquids Scaling up mixers for non-newtonian like kids is more complicated than for newtonian fluids since the apparent viscosity is affected by the shear rate which may vary considerably from one region to another in the mixing vessel With shear-thinning fluids such as polymer melts and biologic can liquids the apparent viscosity is lowest at or near the impeller and higher sometimes much higherâncar the vessel wall where the liquid velocity may be low or even negligible This has led to use of the term cavern to describe the well mixed turbulent region around the impeller walkers et all give an equation for predicting cavern diameter They also describe scale procedures for power-law fluids both pseudoplastic and dilatant based on the use of equal refolds numbers equal relative cavern diameter equal tip speed equal torque per unit volume equal bulk fluid velocity equal power per unit volume equal proud numbers and equal blend times In the absence of any other obvious criterion they recommend that scale be based on equal power per unit volume Scaling down As was shown in Example 9.6, it may be impractical to keep a constant blending time on scaling up to a much larger vessel If the blending time is critical as it often is when fast reactions are taking place a scale-down approach should be used.7! The blending time in the large vessel is predicted for a practical power input then tests are made in the small unit at a stirrer speed that gives the same blending time The scale-down approach is also recommended when the rate of mass transfer to drops bubbles or suspended solid particles influences the overall reaction rate or the selectivity in a complex system Small laboratory reactors may be operated at 100 ta 200 hp/}.000 gal (20 to 40 kW/m*) to get very high mass transfer rates but scale at constant power input per unit volume (P/V) would be impractical The agitation conditions in the large reactor should be tentatively chosen to give a real unable power input and then tests made in the small reactor a a stirrer speed that gives the same pave Even though this may give a lower overall reaction rate a change in performance on scale is less likely SYMBOLS a Area of cylinder swept out by tips of impeller blades my or to a Interfacial area per unit volume my or to B Solids concentration in suspension [Eq.

, SECTION i Practically all the operations that are carried out by the chemical engineer involve the production or absorption of energy in the form of heat The laws governing the transfer of heat and the types of apparatus that have for their main object the control of heat flow are therefore of great importance This section of the book deals with heat transfer and its applications in process engineering Nature of heat flow When two objects at different temperatures are brought into contact heat flows from the object at the higher temperature to that at the lower temperature The net flow is always in the direction of the temperature decrease The mechanisms by which the heat may flow are three conduction convection and radiation conduction If a temperature gradient exists in a continuous substance heat can flow unaccompanied by any observable motion of matter Heat flow of this kind is called conduction and according to couriers law the heat flux is proportional to the temperature gradient and opposite to it in sign For one-dimensional heat flow couriers law is do aT c an oo a a do where g = rate of heat flow in direction normal to surface A = surface area T = temperature X i distance normal to surface k = proportionality constant or thermal conductivity In metals thermal conduction results from the motion of free electrons and there is close correspondence between thermal conductivity and electrical 295

296 SECTION 111: Heat Transfer and lis Applications conductivity In solids that are poor conductors of electricity and in most liquids thermal conduction results from momentum transfer between adjacent vibrating molecules or atoms In gases conduction occurs by the random motion of mole rules so that heat is diffused from hotter regions to colder ones The most come on example of pure conduction is heat flow in opaque solids such as the brick wall of a furnace or the metal wall of a heat exchanger tube Conduction of heat in high kids or gases is often influenced by flow of the fluids and both conductive and con receive processes are lumped together under the term convection or convective heat transfer convection Convection can refer to the flow of heat associated with the move went of fluid such as when hot air from a furnace enters a room or to the transfer of heat from a hot surface to a flowing fluid The second meaning is more important for unit operations as it includes heat transfer from metal walls solid particles and liquid surfaces The convective flux is usually proportional to the difference between the surface temperature and the temperature of the fluid as stated in Newton's law of cooling 4 her â7;) (111.2) A where i = surface temperature to = bulk temperature of fluid far from surface h = heat-transfer coefficient Note that the linear dependence on the temperature driving force i i i is the same as that for pure conduction in a solid of constant thermal conductivity as can be shown by integrating end (III.1). Unlike thermal conductivity the heat-transfer coefficient is not an intrinsic property of the fluid but depends on the flow patterns determined by fluid mechanics as well as on the thermal properties of the fluid If to i to > i heat will be transferred from the fluid to the surface Natural and forced convection When currents in a fluid result from buoyancy forces created by density differences and the density differences are caused by temperature gradients in the fluid the action is called natural convection When the currents are due to a mechanical device such as a pump or agitators the How ts index pendent of density differences and is called forced convection Buoyancy forces also exist in forced convection but usually they have only a small effect radiation Radiation is a term given to the transfer of energy through space by electromagnetic waves If radiation is passing through empty space it is not trash formed to heat or any other form of energy nor is it diverted from its path if how ever matter appears in its path the radiation will be transmitted reflected or abs sorbed It is only the absorbed energy that appears as heat and this transformation is quantitative For example fused quartz transmits practically all the radiation that strikes it a polished opaque surface or mirror will reflect most of the radiation impinging on it a black or matte surface will absorb most of the radiation received by it and will transform such absorbed energy quantitatively to heat

SECTION 111: Heat Transfer and Its Applications 297 The energy emitted by a black body is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature we = a (1.3) where we = rate of radiant energy emission per until area o = Stefan-Boltzmann constant T = absolute temperature Monatomic and most diatomic gases are transparent to thermal radiation and it is quite common to find that heat is flowing through masses of such gases both by radiation and by conduction-convection. Examples are the Joss of heat from a radio actor or uninsulated steam pipe to the air of a room and heat transfer in furnaces and other high-temperature gas-heating equipment The two mechanisms are mutually independent and occur in parallel so that one type of heat flow can be controlled or varied independently of the other Conduction-convection and radiation can be studied separately and their separate effects added in cases where both are import tanto In very general terms radiation becomes important at high temperatures and is independent of the circumstances of the flow of the guide Conduction-convection is sensitive to flow conditions and is relatively unaffected by temperature level Chapter 10 deals with heat conduction in solids and stationary fluids chaps i to 13 with heat transfer by conduction and convection in fluids in motion and chap 14 with heat transfer by radiation In chaps 15 and 16 the principles developed in prep ceding chapters are applied to the design of equipment for heating cooling condense in and evaporating

CHAPTER 10 Heat Transfer by Conduction Conduction is most easily understood by considering heat flow in homogeneous isotropic solids because in these there is no convection and the effect of radiation is negligible unless the solid is translucent to electromagnetic waves first the general law of conduction is discussed second situations of steady-state heat conduction where the temperature distribution within the solid does not change with time are treated third some simple cases of unsteady conduction where the temperature distribution does change with time are considered BASIC LAW OF CONDUCTION The basic relation for heat flow by conduction is the proportionality between heat flux and the temperature gradient It is known as couriers law which for steady one-dimensional flow in the x direction has already been given by end (II.1).

CHAPTER 10: Heat Transfer by Conduction 301 (240 Btu/ft-h-Â°F) for silver The thermal conductivity of metals is generally nearly constant or decreases slightly as the temperature is increased and the conductivity of alloys is less than that of pure metals For glass and most nonporous materials the thermal conductivities are much lower from about 0.35 to 3.5 W/m-Â°C (0.2 to 2 Btu/ft- he Â°F): for these materials & may either increase or decrease as the temper nature rises For inmost liquids & is lower than that for solids with typical values of about 0.17 we doc (0.1 Btu/ft-h- Â°F), and & decreases by 3 to 4 percent for a 10Â°C rise in temperature Water is an exception with k=0.5 to 0.7 Wim-Â°C (0.3 to 0.4 Bru/ft-h-Â°F), and & goes through a maximum as the temperature is raised Gases have thermal conductivities an order of magnitude lower than those for liquids For an ideal gas k is proportional to the average molecular velocity the mean free path and the molar heat capacity For monatomic gases a hard-sphere model gives the theoretical equation my I 1 = 2082 (1) 106) of M where 7 = temperature K M = molecular weight o = effective collision diameter A K = thermal conductivity we - K Note the similarity of end (10.6) to end (3.5) for estimating the viscosity of simple gases Both equations contain the term the /o?, but momentum transfer as shown by end (3.5), varies with M!/? whereas the thermal conductivity depends on mom Equation (10.6) generally underestimates the thermal conductivity of poly atomic gases which have higher heat capacities than monatomic gases because of the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom The higher heat capacities can also make k increase quite rapidly with temperature A change from 300 K to 600 K may increase the thermal conductivity i to 4-fold, Several methods of predicting & for gases and gas mixtures are reviewed by read et all The thermal conductivity of gases is nearly independent of pressure up to about 10 bars at higher pressures & increases slightly with pressure Values of & for some solids liquids and gases are given in apply 6 and 10 through 13. More complete tables are available in the literature Solids having low thermal conductivities are used for insulation on pipes vest else and buildings Porous materials such as fiberglass pads or polymer foams act by entrapping air and eliminating convection Their & values may be nearly as low as that of air itself and if a high-molecular-weight gas is trapped in a closed-cell foam k can be less than that for air STEADY-STATE CONDUCTION Simple examples of steady-state conduction are shown in fig 10.1.

The temperature gradient in the fluid near the surface is shown as a straight line which implies heat transfer by conduction through a thin stagnant layer and perfectly mixed fluid outside this layer With fluid flowing past the surface the actual gradient is slightly curved but a linear gradient is shown for convenience and this does not affect the subsequent derivations There is no accuse mutation of energy at the interface so the heat flux to the surface equals the flux into the solid and the change in gradient at the interface reflects the difference in conductivities In this example the thermal conductivity of the solid is assumed to be less than that of the fluid so the temperature gradient is steeper in the solid than in the aside With increasing time the gradient in the solid and the heat flux decrease and the surface temperature increases since a lower driving force is needed to transfer heat through the fluid layer When there is an external resistance end (10.18) for conduction in the solid still applies but a new boundary condition is needed The heat flux into the solid is equated to the rate of heat transfer through the fluid layer as given by Newton's law for convective heat transfer q owe to =h(T, i i = sky i (10.26) A axe ASS FIGURE 10.6 t is Temperature gradients in and near a slab in i - we being heated from one side ass o N nays my x ta less we boy SS Insulation SS SS SS SS As PEN SS SS 4 in to rosy in we

CHAPTER i Principles of Heat Flow in Fluids Heat transfer from a warmer fluid to a cooler fluid usually through a solid wall sept rating the two fluids is common in chemical engineering practice The heat trash feared may be latent heat accompanying a phase change such as condensation or vaporization or it may be sensible heat from the rise or fall in the temperature of a fluid without any phase change Typical examples are reducing the temperature of a fluid by transfer of sensible heat to a cooler fluid the temperature of which is increased thereby condensing steam using cooling water and vaporizing water from a solution at a given pressure by condensing steam at a higher pressure All such cases require that heat be transferred by conduction and convection TYPICAL HEAT-EXCHANGE EQUIPMENT To establish a basis for the specific discussion of heat transfer to and from flowing fluids consider the simple tubular condenser of fig 11.1. It consists essentially of a bundle of parallel tubes a the ends of which are expanded into tube sheets be and be The tube bundle is inside a cylindrical shell C and is provided with two channels do and do one at each end and two channel covers i and Â£,. Steam or other pure vapor is introduced through nozzle F into the shell-side space surrounding the tubes condensate is withdrawn through connection go and any incondensable gas that might be present at startup or that might enter with the inlet vapor is removed through vent xu Connection G leads to a trap which is a device that allows liquid to flow but holds back vapor The fluid to be heated is pumped through connection # into channel do It flows through the tubes into the other channel do and is dish charged through connection ja The two fluids are physically separated but are in thermal contact with the thin metal tube walls separating them Heat flows through the tube walls from the condensing vapor to the cooler fluid in the tubes 325

The horizontal line represents the temperature of the condensing vapor and the curved line below it represents the rising temperature of the tube-side fluid In fig 11.2, the inlet and outlet fluid temperatures are i and to i respectively and the constant temperature of the vapor is i at length L from the entrance end of the tubes the fluid temperature is i and the local difference between the temperatures of vapor and fluid is i i 7,. This temperature difference is called a point temperature difference and is denoted by at The point tempera sure difference at the inlet of the tubes is i i T.,,. denoted by at and that at the exit end is i i T.,, denoted by at The terminal point temperature differences at and at are called the approaches The change in temperature of the fluid 7,,, ~ T.,, is called the temperature range or simply the range In a condenser there is but one range that of the cold fluid being heated In this text the symbol AT is used exclusively to signify a temperature differ once between two objects or two fluids It does nor denote the temperature change in given fluid A second example of simple heat-transfer equipment is the double-pipe exchanger shown in fig 11.3. it is assembled of standard metal pipe and standard iced return bends and return heads the latter equipped with stuffing boxes One fluid

An automobile radiator and the condenser in a home refrigerator are examples of crossbow heat exchangers ENERGY BALANCES Quantitative attack on heat-transfer problems is based on energy balances and stir nations of rates of heat transfer Rates of transfer are discussed later in this chapter many perhaps most heat-transfer devices operate under steady-state conditions and only steady-state operation is considered here Transient processes such as heal in liquids in tanks are discussed in chap 15. Enthalpy balances in heat exchangers In heat exchangers there is no shaft work and mechanical potential and kinetic energies are small in comparison with the other terms in the energy-balance equation thus for one stream through the exchanger may i he = q (11.2) where m = flow rate of stream q = it = rate of heat transfer into seam H,,. my = enthalpies per unit mass of stream at entrance and exit respectively Equation (11.2) can be written for each stream flowing through the exchanger A further simplification in the use of the heat-transfer rate q is justified One of the two fluid streams that outside the tubes can gain or lose heat by transfer with the ambient air if the fluid is colder or hotter than the ambient Heat transfer to or from the ambient is not usually desired in practice and it is usually reduced to a small magnitude by suitable insulation It is customary to neglect it in comparison with the heat transfer through the walls of the tubes from the warm fluid to the cold fluid and q is interpreted accordingly

CHAPTER 11: Principles of Heat Flow in Fluids 331 HEAT FLUX AND HEAT-TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS Heat-transfer calculations are based on the area of the heating surface and are ex pressed in watts per square meter or but per hour per square foot of surface through which the heat flows The rate of heat transfer per unit area is called the heat flux In many types of heat-transfer equipment the transfer surfaces are constructed from tubes or pipe Heat fluxes may then be based on either the inside area or the outside area of the tubes Although the choice is arbitrary it must be clearly stated because the numerical magnitude of the heat fluxes will not be the same for both Average temperature of fluid stream When a fluid is being heated or cooled the temperature will vary throughout the cross section of the stream If the fluid is being heated the temperature of the fluid is a maximum at the wall of the heating surface and decreases toward the center of the stream If the fluid is being cooled the temperature is a minimum at the wall and in creases toward the center Because of these temperature gradients throughout the cross section of the stream it is necessary for definiteness to state what is meant by the temperature of the stream It is agreed that it is the temperature that would be at trained if the entire fluid stream flowing across the section in question were with drawn and mixed adiabatically to a uniform temperature The temperature so defined is called the average or mixing-cup stream temperature The temperatures plotted in fig 11.4 are all average stream temperatures Overall Heat-Transfer Coefficient As shown in chap 10, else (10.7) and (10.11), the heat flux through layers of solids in series is proportional to a driving force the overall temperature difference at This also applies to heat flow through liquid layers and solids in series In a heat ex changer the driving force is taken as the i the where the is the average temperature of the hot fluid and i is that of the cold fluid The quantity 7;, i to is the overall local temperature difference at It is clear from fig 11.4 that AT can vary considerably from point to point along the tube and therefore since the heat flux is proportional to at the flux also varies with tube length it is necessary to start with a different till equation by focusing attention on a differential area a through which a differ entail heat flow do occurs under the driving force of a local value of at The local flux is then dada and is related to the local value of AT by the equation a - i = at =U(T, - the (11.9) a The quantity up defined by end (11.9) as a proportionality factor between dada and at is called the local overall heat-transfer coefficient To complete the definition of U for a tubular exchanger it is necessary to specify the area If A is taken as the outside tube area A,,, then U becomes a coefti- client based on that area and is written up likewise if the inside area a is chosen

The assumptions are that (1) the overall coefficient U is constant (2) the specific heats of the hot and cold fluids are constant (3) heat exchange with the ambient air is negligible and (4) the flow is steady and either parallel or counter current as shown in fig 11.4. The most questionable of these assumptions is that of a constant overall coffin client The coefficient does in fact vary with the temperatures of the fluids but its change with temperature is gradual so that when the temperature ranges are mode eaten the assumption of constant U ts not seriously in error Assumptions 2 and 4 imply that if i and i are plotted against ya as shown in fig 11.5, straight lines are obtained Since i and i vary linearly with go AT does likewise and d(AT)/dq. the slope of the graph of AT versus go is constant Therefore adnate at i at we d1.11) do go all Pas e Tho of to i q T.vsq g if 3 he | & E Ay 2 to â_â AT vs at | Pe are oO or q FIGURE 11.5 Temperature versus heat flow rate in countercurrent flow

The let is also incorrect when heat is transferred to or from a reacting fluid in a jacketed reactor Figure 11.7 shows the temperature profiles for an exothermic reaction in a water-cooled reactorâthe lower line shows the temperature of the coolant the upper line that of the reacting mixture Because of heat generated by the reaction the reactant temperature rises rapidly near the reactor inlet and then as the reaction slows the reactant temperature drops The as at both the reactor inlet and reactor outlet are relatively small Clearly the average temperature drop is much greater than the drop at either end of the reactor and cannot be found from the logarithmic mean of the terminal ATâs.

Individual Heat-Transfer Coefficients The overall coefficient depends on many variables including the physical properties of the fluids and of the solid wall the flow rates and the exchanger dimensions The only logical way to predict the overall coefficient is to use correlations for the indie visual resistances of the solid and the fluid layers and to add these resistances to find the overall resistance which is the reciprocal of the overall coefficient Consider the local overall coefficient at a specific point in the double-pipe exchanger shown in fig 11.3. For definiteness assume that the warm fluid is flowing through the inside

CHAPTER it Principles of Heat Flow in Fluids 337 it was shown in chap 5 that in turbulent flow through conduits three zones exist even in single fluid so that the study of one fluid is itself complicated In each fluid shown in fig 1.8 there is a thin slayer at the wall a turbulent core occupying most of the cross section of the stream and a buffer zone between them The veloce it gradients were described in chap 5. The velocity gradient is large near the wall small in the turbulent core and in rapid change in the buffer zone It has been found that the temperature gradient in a fluid being heated or cooled when flowing in turn blent flow follows much the same course The temperature gradient is large at the wall and through the viscous sublayer, small in the turbulent core and in rapid change in the buffer zone basically the reason for this is that heat must flow through the viscous slayer by conduction which calls for a steep temperature gradient in most fluids because of the low thermal conductivity whereas the rapidly moving edh dies in the core are effective in equalizing the temperature in the turbulent zone In the buffer zone there are fewer eddies than in the turbulent zone but they add signify scantly to the conductive heat transfer In fig 11.8 the dashed lines of and of represent the boundaries of the viscous slayer and of the buffer zone The average temperature of the warm stream is somewhat less than the maxi mum temperature i and is represented by the horizontal line my which is drawn at temperature 7), likewise line and drawn at temperature 7,, represents the average temperature of the cold fluid The overall resistance to the flow of heat from the warm fluid to the cold fluid is a result of three separate resistances operating in series In general as shown in fig 11.8. the wall resistance is small in comparison with that of the fluids The fluid resistances are generally computed by using correlations for individual heat-transfer coefficients or film coefficients which are the reciprocals of the resistances The film coefficient for the warm fluid is defined by the equation he = lot (11.18) to i Fan For the cold fluid the terms in the denominator are reversed to make i positive my i harder 119) be where dy,âÂ¢A = local heat flux based on area in contact with fluid the = local average temperature of warm fluid to = local average temperature of cold fluid the = temperature of wall on cold side T.,, = temperature of wall on warm side Often tyg i tyg is small and the is used for the wall temperature on both sides The reciprocals of these coefficients 1/f, and | //,. have the thermal resistances For conduction through a solid such as a metal wall of thickness xu and thermal conductivity ka the thermal resistance equals x,/k.

The dimensionless group ask is called a mussels number nut That shown in end (11.22) is a local mussels number based on did meters The physical meaning of the mussels number can be seen by inspection of the right-hand side of end (11.22). The numerator (d7/dy),, is of course the gradient at the wall The factor i i T,,)/D can be considered the average temperature gradient across the entire pipe and the mussels number is the ratio of these two gradients Another interpretation of the mussels number can be obtained by considering the gradient that would exist if all the resistance to heat transfer were in a laminar layer of thickness x in which heat transfer was only by conduction The heat transfer rate and coefficient follow from else (10.1) and (11.18) 1 kept - to a _ up ~ two (11,23) a x k he (11.24) x From the definition of the mussels number AD kid D we anus it (11.25) k xu x The mussels number is the ratio of the tube diameter to the equivalent thickness of the laminar layer Sometimes x is called the film thickness and it is generally slightly greater than the thickness of the laminar boundary layer because there is some resistance to heat transfer in the buffer zone

CHAPTER 12 Heat Transfer to Fluids Without Phase Change In a great many applications of heat exchange heat is transferred between fluid streams without any phase change in the fluids This is especially important in heat recovery operations such as when the hot effluent from an exothermic reactor is used to preheat the incoming cooler feed Other examples include the transfer of heat from a stream of hot gas to cooling water and the cooling of a hot liquid stream by air In such situations the two streams are separated by a metal wall which con statutes the heat-transfer surface The surface may consist of tubes or other channels of constant cross section of flat plates or in such devices as jet engines and add danced power machinery of special shapes designed to pack a maximum area of transfer surface into a small volume Most fluid-to- fluid heat transfer is accomplished in steady-state equipment but thermal regenerator in which a bed of solid shapes is alternately heated by a hot fluid and the hot shapes then used to warm a colder fluid are also used expel really in high-temperature heat transfer Regenerator performance is discussed in chap 15. BOUNDARY LAYERS Regimes of heat transfer A fluid being heated or cooled may be flowing in laminar flow in turbulent flow or in the transition range between laminar and turbulent flow also the fluid may be flowing in forced or natural convection In some instances more than one flow type may occur in the same stream for instance in laminar flow at low veloce cities natural convection may be superimposed on forced laminar flow The direction of flow of the fluid may be parallel to that of the heating surface so that boundary layer separation does not occur or the direction of flow may be 347

Since the temperature varies from point to point in a flowing stream undergoing heat transfer a problem appears in the choice of temperature at which the properties should be evaluated For small temp creature differences between fluid and wall and for fluids with weak dependence of Viscosity on temperature the problem is not acute But for highly viscous fluids such as heavy petroleum oils or where the temperature difference between the tube wall and the fluid is large the variations in fluid properties within the stream become large and the difficulty of calculating the heat-transfer rate is increased Because of the various effects noted above the entire subject of heat transfer to fluids without phase change is complex and in practice is treated as a series of special cases rather than as a general theory All cases considered in this chapter do however have a phenomenon in common In all the formation of a thermal bound are layer analogous to the hydrodynamic prandial boundary layer described in chap 3. takes place it profoundly influences the temperature field and so controls the rate of heat flow Thermal boundary layer Consider a flat plate immersed in a stream of fluid that is in steady flow parole let to the plate as shown in fig 12.]a@.

In injection molding for example polymer melt flows into the cavity at a very high velocity and the steep velocity gradients in the viscous liquid cause heat to be generated in the fluid by what is called viscous dissipation In the high-velocity flow of come possible gases in pipes friction at the wall raises the temperature of the fluid at the wall above the average fluid temperature The temperature difference between wail and fluid causes a flow of heat from wall to fluid and a steady state is reached when the rate of heat generation from friction at the wall equals the rate of heat transfer back into the fluid stream The constant wall temperature thus attained is called the adiabatic wall temperature see chap 6). The effect becomes appreciable for much numbers above approximately 0.4, and appropriate equations must be used in this range of velocities instead of else (12.33) and (12.34).

The instantaneous temperature to at the point can be split into two parts the constant average temperature 7 at the point and the fluctuating or deviating temperature 7â, or T=T+T' (12.44) The time average of the deviating temperature 7â, denoted by 7â, is zero and the time-average value of the total instantaneous temperature denoted by 7;, is to The average temperature T is that measured by an ordinary thermometer To measure i and thus find i requires special sensing devices that can follow rapid temperature changes The eddy diffusivity of heat When there is no temperature gradient across the isothermal surface all eddies have the same temperature independent of the point of origin study = 0. and no net heat flow occurs If a temperature gradient exists an analysis equivalent to that leading to end (3.17) shows that the eddies carry a net heat flux from the higher temp creature to the lower in accordance with the equation i = ~cppv'T' (12.45) where v is the deviating velocity across the surface and the overbear indicates the time average of the product v'7â.

The 0.9 exponent for Re is consistent with the value reported for mass transfer at high schist numbers (Eq. (17.67)].

NATURAL CONVECTION As an example of natural convection consider a hot vertical plate in contact with the air in 4 room The temperature of the air in contact with the plate will be that of the surface of the place and a temperature gradient will exist from the plate out into the room At the bottom of the plate the temperature gradient is steep as shown by the full line marked z = 10 my in fig 12.7.

CHAPTER 12: Heat Transfer to Fluids Without Phase change 377 of the plate the gradient becomes less steep as shown by the full curve marked z = 240 my of fig 12.7. At a height of about 600 my from the bottom of the plate the temperatureâdistance curves approach an asymptotic condition and do not change with further increase in height The density of the heated air immediately adjacent to the plate is less than that of the unheated air at a distance from the plate and the buoyancy of the hot air causes an unbalance between the vertical layers of air of differing density The uni balanced forces generate a circulation by which hot air near the plate rises and cold air flows toward the plate from the room to replenish the rising airstream A veloce it gradient near the plate is formed Since the velocities of the air in contact with the plate and out in the room are both zero the velocity is a maximum at a definite distance from the wall The velocity reaches its maximum a few millimeters from the surface of the plate The dashed curves in fig 12.7 show the velocity gradients for heights of 10 and 240 my above the bottom of the plate The temperature difference between the surface of the plate and the air in the room at a distance from the plate causes a transfer of heat by conduction into the current of gas next to the wall and the stream carries the heat away by convection in a direction parallel to the plate The natural convection currents surrounding a hot horizontal pipe are more complicated than those adjacent to a vertical heated plate but the mechanism of the process is similar The layers of air immediately next to the bottom and sides of the pipe are heated and tend to rise The rising layers of hot air one on each side of the pipe separate from the pipe at points short of the top center of the pipe and form two independent rising currents with a zone of relatively stagnant and uni heated air between them Natural convection in liquids follows the same pattern because liquids are also less dense hot than cold The buoyancy of heated liquid layers near a hot surface generates convection currents Just as in gases On the assumption that 4 depends upon pipe diameter specific heat thermal conductivity viscosity coefficient of thermal expansion acceleration of gravity density and temperature difference dimensional analysis gives 342 see = 0 see of port (12.65) k k we Since the effect of 8 is through buoyancy in a gravitational field the product up AT acts as a single factory and the last two groups fuse into a dimensionless group called the Grashof number are destined by 3 2 or go = decide Ale (12.66) My For single horizontal cylinders the heat-transfer coefficient can be correlated by an equation containing three dimensionless groups the mussels number the prandial number and the Grashof number or specifically 2 Do _ cots polys at (12.67) my my my

CHAPTER 13 Heat Transfer to Fluids With Phase Change Processes of heat transfer accompanied by phase change are more complex than simple heat exchange between fluids A phase change involves the addition or sub traction of considerable quantities of heat at constant or nearly constant tempera sure The rate of phase change may be governed by the rate of heat transfer but it is often influenced by the rate of nucleation of bubbles drops or crystals and by the behavior of the new phase after it is formed This chapter covers condensation of vapors and boiling of liquids Crystallization is discussed in chap 27. HEAT TRANSFER FROM CONDENSING VAPORS The condensation of vapors on the surfaces of tubes cooler than the condensing temp creature of the vapor is important when vapors such as those of water hydrocarbons and other volatile substances are processed Some examples will be met later in this text in discussing the unit operations of evaporation distillation and drying The condensing vapor may consist of a single substance a mixture of condense able and incondensable substances or a mixture of two or more condensable vapors Friction losses in a condenser are normally small so that condensation is essentially a constant-pressure process The condensing temperature of a single pure substance depends only on the pressure and therefore the process of condensation of a pure substance is isothermal also the condensate is a pure liquid Mixed vapors condensing at constant pressure condense over a temperature range and yield a con sensate of variable composition until the entire vapor stream is condensed when the composition of the condensate equals that of the original condensed vapor exceptions to this statement are found in the condensation of allotropic mixtures where the equilib- rum compositions of the condensate and the vapor are always the same 388

CHAPTER 13: Heat Transfer to Fluids With Phase Change 389 Common examples of condensation in the presence of an inert gas are the con sensation of water from a mixture of steam and air and the recovery of hydrocarbon solvents from air streams leaving extraction or drying operations Condensation of mixed vapors and condensation in the presence of noncom denying gases are discussed briefly later in this chapter The following discussion is limited to the condensation of a single volatile substance on a cold tube dropline and film-type condensation A vapor may condense on a cold surface in one of two ways which are well described by the terms dropline and film type In film condensation which is more common than dropline condensation the liquid condensate forms a film or continue yous layer of liquid that flows over the surface of the tube under the action of grave it It is the layer of liquid interposed between the vapor and the wall of the tube that provides the resistance to heat flow and therefore fixes the magnitude of the heat transfer coefficient In dropline condensation the condensate begins to form at microscopic nuclei action sites Typical sites are tiny pits scratches and dust specks The drops grow and coalesce with their neighbors to form visible fine drops like those often seen on the outside of a cold-water pitcher in a humid room The fine drops in turn coalesce into rivulets which flow down the tube under the action of gravity sweep away condensate and clear the surface for more droplets During dropline con sensation large areas of the tube surface are covered with an extremely thin film of liquid of negligible thermal resistance Because of this the heat-transfer coffin client at these areas is very high the average coefficient for dropline condensation mas be 5 to 10 times that for film-type condensation On long tubes condensation on some of the surface may be film condensation and the remainder dropline condensation The most important and extensive observations of dropline condensation have been made on steam but it has also been observed in ethylene glycol glycerin nitrobenzene isoheptane, and some other organic vapors.âÂ° Liquid metals usually : condense in the dropline manner The appearance of dropline condensation depends upon the wetting or nonwetting of the surface by the liquid and fundamentally the phenomenon lies in the field of surface chemistry Much of the experimental work on the dropline condensation of steam is summarized in the following paragraphs i Film-type condensation of water occurs on tubes of the common metals if both the steam and the tube are clean in the presence or absence of air on rough or on polished surfaces 2. dropline condensation is obtainable only when the cooling surface is not wet ted by the liquid In the condensation of steam it is often induced by contaminate on of the vapor with droplets of oil It is more easily maintained on a smooth surface than on a rough surface 3. The quantity of contaminant or promoter required to cause dropline condensed on is minutes and apparently only a monomolecular film is necessary 4. Effective drop promoters are strongly adsorbed by the surface and substances that merely prevent wetting are ineffective Some promoters are especially

The average coefficient obtainable in pure dropline condensation may be as high as 115 kW/m?-Â°C (20,000 Btu/ft?- Â°F). Although attempts are sometimes made to realize practical benefits from these large coefficients by artificially inducing dropline condensation this type of con sensation is so unstable and the difficulty of maintaining it so great that the method is not common Also the resistance of the layer of steam condensate even in film type condensation is ordinarily small in comparison with the resistance inside the condenser tube and the increase in the overall coefficient is relatively small when dropline condensation is achieved For normal design therefore film-type con sensation is assumed Coefficients for film-type condensation The basic equations for the rate of heat transfer in film-type condensation were first derived by Nusselt.!7"!*? The mussels equations are based on the assumption that the vapor and liquid at the outside boundary of the liquid layer are in thermos dynamic equilibrium so that the only resistance to the flow of heat is that offered by the layer of condensate flowing downward in laminar flow under the action of grave it It is also assumed that the velocity of the liquid at the wall is zero that the velocity of the liquid at the outside of the film is not influenced by the velocity of the vapor and that the temperatures of the wall and the vapor are constant super heat in the vapor is neglected the condensate is assumed to leave the tube at the condensing temperature and the physical properties of the liquid are taken at the mean film temperature Vertical tubes In film-type condensation the mussels theory shows that the condensate film starts to form at the top of the tube and that the thickness of the film increases rapidly near the top of the tube and then more and more slowly in the red raining length The heat is assumed to flow through the condensate till solely by conduction and the local coefficient i is therefore given by my 4 he 5 (13.1) where 6 is the local film thickness The local coefficient therefore changes inversely with the film thickness The variations of both a and 8 with distance from the top of the tube are shown for a liquid tike methanol in fig 13.1.17 Film thickness 4 is typically two or three orders of magnitude smaller than the tube diameter it can therefore be found for flow either inside or outside a tube from the equation for a flat plate end (4.59). Since there is a temperature gradient in the film the properties of the liquid are evaluated at the average film temperature the given water by end (13.11).

398 SECTION 111: Heat transfer and Its Applications Condensation of superheated vapors of the vapor entering a condenser is superheated both the sensible heat of super heat and the latent heat of condensation must be transferred through the cooling sure face For steam because of the low specific heat of the superheated vapor and the large latent heat of condensation the heat of superheat is usually small in compared son with the latent heat For example 50Â°C of superheat represents only 100 jog as compared with approximately 2,300 jog for latent heat In the condensation of organic vapors such as petroleum fractions the superheat may be appreciable in comparison with the latent heat When the heat of superheat is important either it can be calculated from the degrees of superheat and the specific heat of the vapor and added to the latent heat or if tables of thermal properties are available the total heat transferred per pound of vapor can be calculated by subtracting the enthalpy of the condensate from that of the superheated vapor The effect of superheat on the rate of heat transfer depends upon whether the temperature of the surface of the tube is higher or lower than the condensation temp creature of the vapor If the temperature of the tube is lower than the temperature of condensation the tube is wet with condensate just as in the condensation of sat rated vapor and the temperature of the outside boundary of the condensate layer equals the saturation temperature of the vapor at the pressure existing in the equip went The situation is complicated by the presence of a thermal resistance between the bulk of the superheated vapor and the outside of the condensate film and by the existence of a temperature drop which is equal to the degrees of superheat in the vapor across that resistance practically however the net effect of these complicate tons is small and it is satisfactory to assume that the entire heat load which con sits of the heats of superheat and of condensation is transferred through the condensate film that the temperature drop is that across the condensate film and that the coefficient is the average coefficient for condensing vapor as read from fig 13.2. The procedure is summarized by the equation go =haA(T, âT,) (13.18) where go = total heat transferred including latent heat and superheat A = area of heat-transfer surface in contact with vapor h = coefficient of heat transfer from fig 13.2 the = saturation temperature of vapor to temperature of tube wall When the vapor is highly superheated and the exit temperature of the cooling fluid is close to that of condensation the temperature of the tube wall may be greater than the saturation temperature of the vapor condensation cannot occur and the tube wall will be dry The tube wall remains dry until the superheat has been red ducked to a point where the tube wall becomes cooler than the condensing tempera sure of the vapor and condensation takes place The equipment can be considered as two sections one a desuperheater and the other a condenser In calculations the two sections must be considered separately The desuperheater is essentially a gas cooler The logarithmic mean temperature difference applies and the heat-transfer coefficient is that for cooling a fixed gas The condensing section is treated by the methods described in the previous paragraphs
Page 414:
CHAPTER 13: Heat Transfer to Fluids With Phase Change 399 Because of the low individual coefficient on the gas side the overall coefficient in the desuperheater section is small and the area of the heating surface in that section is large in comparison with the amount of heat removed This situation should be avoided in practice Superheat can be eliminated more economically by injection of a spray of liquid directly into the superheated vapor since small drops evaporate very rapidly cooling the vapor to the saturation temperature The desuperheating section is thereby eliminated and condensation occurs with high coefficients Condensation of mixed vapors If the vapor contains two or more volatile components unless it is an allotropic mixture the condensation temperature is no longer constant at a given pressure Concentration gradients exist in both the vapor and liquid phases as the higher boiling-point component or components tend to condensed enriching the vapor in lower-boiling-point material If the coolant temperature is low enough all the vapor may eventually be condensed the composition of the condensate will then be the same as that of the original vapor In other cases some of the low-boiling-point material may not be condensed and must be vented from the condenser Because of the concentration gradients in the vapor there is mass transfer of the higher-boiling-point components to the condensate surface through the union denied Jower-boiling-point components of the vapor This occurs in parallel with heat transfer to remove sensible heat from the vapor as is cools In general the rates of heat and mass transfer and the corresponding heat and mass-transfer coffin clients vary throughout the condenser and must be estimated at several points The required area is then found by an iterative procedure For binary systems a design method was developed by column and drew For cases where the controlling red distance for heat and mass transfer in the vapor is the sensible-heat removal from the cooling vapor a procedure is outlined in Reference 24b. Effect of noncondensables When a multicomponent mixture contains a nonconsenting gas the rate of condensation is seriously reduced As in the condensation of a mixture of condense able vapors there is mass transfer of one or more components in the vapor phase but here the condensing molecules must diffuse through a film of nonconsenting gas which does not move toward the condensate surface As condensation proceeds the relative amount of this inert gas in the vapor phase increases significantly the partial pressure of the condensing vapor is less than the total pressure which lowers the equilibrium condensation temperature In addition the partial pressure of the condensing vapor at the condensate surface must be less than it is in the bulk vapor-gas phase to provide the driving force for mass transfer through the gas film This further lowers the condensing temperature and usually the change in tempera sure due to mass transfer is greater than the change in the equilibrium temperature Even a small amount of gas can have a large effect on the rate of condensation Less than | percent air in steam can reduce the condensation rate by more than one half and 5 percent of inert gas can decrease the steam condensation rate by a Mass transfer is discussed in chaps 17 through 19.

Whenever air or other incondensable gas is present in the feed a fraction of the incoming gas must be vented from the condenser If the vapor fed to a invented condenser for instance contains 0.1 percent air and 99 percent of the vapor is condensed then the remaining vapor will contain 10 percent air and the condensation rate will be quite how in the last part of the condenser Figure 13.3 shows the profiles of temperature and partial pressure in such a condenser The condensing temperature drops as the composition of the gas-vapor mixture and hence its dew point changes as condensation proceeds Rigorous methods of solving the general problem are based on equating the heat flow to the condensate surface at any point to the heat flow away from the surface This involves trial-and-error solutions for the point temperature of the condensate sure face and from these an estimation of the point values of the heat flux U at The vale us of 1/(U at for each point are plotted against the heat transferred to that point and the area of the condenser surface found by numerical integration A condenser for mixtures of vapors and incondensable gases is illustrated in fig 15.16, pa 470. HEAT TRANSFER TO BOILING LIQUIDS Heat transfer to a boiling liquid is a necessary step in evaporation distillation and steam generation and it may also be used to control the temperature of a chemical reactor The boiling liquid may be contained in a vessel equipped with a heating surface fabricated from horizontal or vertical tubes in which steam or other vapor is condensed or hot fluid is circulated to supply the heat needed to boil the liquid alternatively the liquid to be boiled may flow under either natural or forced con section inside heated tubes An important application of boiling in tubes is the evaporation of water from solution as discussed later and in chap 16. When boiling is accomplished by a hot immersed surface the temperature of the mass of the liquid is the same as the boiling point of the liquid under the pressure existing in the equipment Bubbles of vapor are generated at the heating surface rise through the mass of liquid and disengage from the surface of the liquid Vapor accumulates in a vapor space over the liquid a vapor outlet from the

This curve can be divided into four segments In the first segment at low temperature drops the line a is straight and has a slope of 1.25. This is consistent with the correlation for natural convection [Eq.

The second segment terminates at a definite point of maximum flux which is point C in fig 13.4. The temperature drop corresponding to point is called the critical temperature drop and the flux at

Bubbles form on the surface of the heater are released from it rise to the surface of the liquid and are disengaged into the vapor space but they are too few to disturb appreciably the normal currents of free convection At larger temperature drops lying between 9 and 45Â°F i and 25Â°C) in the case shown in fig 13.5, the rate of bubble production is large enough for the stream of bubbles moving up through the liquid to increase the velocity of the circulation cure rents in the mass of liquid and the coefficient of heat transfer becomes greater than

404Â° SECTION (11: Heat Transfer and Its Applications Film boiling is not usually desired in commercial equipment because the heat transfer rate is low for such a large temperature drop Heat-transfer apparatus should be so designed and operated that the temperature drop in the film of boiling liquid is smaller than the critical temperature drop although with cryogenic liquids this is not always feasible The effectiveness of nucleate boiling depends primarily on the ease with which bubbles form and free themselves from the heating surface The layer of liquid next to the hot surface is superheated by contact with the wall of the heater The super heated liquid tends to form vapor spontaneously and so relieve the superheat It is the tendency of superheated liquid to flash into vapor that provides the impetus for the boiling process physically the flash can occur only by forming vapor-liquid interfaces in the form of small bubbles It is not easy however to form a small bub be in a superheated liquid because the vapor pressure over a concave surface is less than the normal value and the smaller the bubble the greater the effect A very small bubble can exist in equilibrium with superheated liquid and the smaller the bubble the greater the equilibrium superheat and the smaller the tendency to flash By taking elaborate precautions to eliminate all gas and other impurities from the liquid and to prevent shock it is possible to superheat water by several hundred de green Fahrenheit without formation of bubbles A second difficulty appears if the bubble does not readily leave the surface once it's formed The important factor in controlling the rate of bubble detachment is the interfacial tension between the liquid and the heating surface If this interfacial ten son is large the bubble tends to spread along the surface and blanket the heat transfer area as shown in fig 13.6c, instead of leaving the surface to make room for other bubbles If the interfacial tension between liquid and solid is low the bubble will pinch off easily in the manner shown in fig 13.6. An example of intermediate interfacial tension is shown in fig 13.6d. The high rate of heat transfer in nucleate boiling is primarily the result of the turbulence generated in the liquid by the dynamic action of the bubbles The coefficient obtained during nucleate boiling is sensitive to a number of variables including the nature of the liquid the type and condition of the heating surface the composition and purity of the liquid the presence or absence of agita tiny and the temperature or pressure Minor changes in some variables cause major changes in the coefficient The reproducibility of check experiments is poor qualitatively the effects of some variables can be predicted from a con liberation of the mechanisms of boiling A roughened surface provides centers for cess liquid ââ- i â-- i Effect on bubble formation of interfacial tension Do to sis between liquid and heating surface after job and to i === = fritz red jo to fa i few i 4 Heating surface

That for or panic liquids may be higher or lower depending largely on how close the operating temperature is to the thermodynamic critical temperature The critical temperature drop can be exceeded in industrial boilers unless prep cautions are taken If the source of heat is another fluid such as condensing steam or hot liquids the only penalty for exceeding the critical temperature drop is a decrease in flux to a level between that at the peak and that at the Leidenfrost point If the heat is supplied by an electric heater exceeding the critical temperature drop may bum out the heater as the boiling liquid cannot absorb heat fast enough at a large temperature drop and the heater immediately becomes very hot The peak flux at the critical temperature drop is large For water it is in the range of 350 to 1,250 kW/m? i 100,000 to 400,000 Buu/ft?-h) depending on the purity of water the pressure and the type and condition of the heating surface For organic liquids the peak flux lies in the range of 125 to 400 kW/mâ (40,000 to 130.000 Btu/ft?-h). These limits apply to boiling under atmospheric pressure on horizontal tube or a flat horizontal surface Many correlations have been proposed for estimating the peak flux from the properties of the fluid based on various models of the physical phenomenal In one approach it is assumed that near the critical temperature drop the streams of bubbles characteristic of nucleate boiling are progressively replaced by jets of vapor leaving the heat-transfer surface These must of course be accompanied by streams of like did flowing toward the surface At the peak value of the heat flux the countercur- rent flows of vapor and liquid reach a limiting condition the process becomes unstable and the jets of vapor collapse to form a continuous vapor sheath The phew noumenon is analogous to the flooding in a packed tower described in chap 18.

CHAPTER 14 Radiation Heat Transfer radiation which may be considered to be energy streaming through space at the speed of light may originate in various ways Some types of material will emit ran dilation when they are treated by external agencies such as electron bombardment electric discharge or radiation of definite wavelengths Radiation due to these eff facts will not be discussed here All substances at temperatures above absolute zero emit radiation that is independent of external agencies Radiation that is the result of temperature only is called thermal radiation and this discussion is restricted to radiation of this type Fundamental facts concerning radiation Radiation moves through space in straight lines or beams and only substances in sight of a radiating body can intercept radiation from that body The fraction of the radiation falling on a body that is reflected is called the reflectivity pa The face ton that is absorbed is called the absorptivity a The fraction that is transmitted is called the transmissivity to The sum of these fractions must be unity or @+tpt+t=) (4.0) Radiation as such is not heat and when transformed to heat on absorption it is no longer radiation In practice however reflected or transmitted radiation usually falls on other absorptive bodies and is eventually converted to heat perhaps after many successive reflections The maximum possible absorptivity is unity attained only if the body absorbs all radiation incident upon it and reflects or transmits none A body that absorbs all incident radiation is called a blackbody The complex subject of thermal radiation transfer has received much study in recent years and is covered in a number of texts.Â°*'Â° The following introduce try treatment discusses the following topics emission of radiation absorption by air

The range between 0.1 and 100 am is important in heat flow by radiation while visible light covers a narrow range of wavelengths from about 0.39 to 0.78 we Thermal radiation at ordinary industrial temperatures has wavelengths in the infrared spectrum which includes waves just longer than the longest visible waves At temperatures above about 500Â°C heat radiation in the visible spectrum becomes significant and the phrases red heat and white heat refer to this fact The higher the temperature of the radiating body the shorter the predominant wave length of the thermal radiation emitted by it For a given temperature the rate of thermal radiation varies with the state of aggregation and the molecular structure of the substance Monatomic and diatomic gases such as oxygen argon and nitrogen radiate weakly even at high tempera turns Under industrial conditions these gases neither emit nor absorb appreciable amounts of radiation Polyatomic gases including water vapor carbon dioxide ammonia sulfur dioxide and hydrocarbons emit and absorb radiation at several wavelengths and infrared absorption at selected wavelengths can be used to anal lye mixtures of such gases Absorption of infrared radiation by polyatomic gases

Each curve rises steeply to a maximum and decreases asymptotically to zero emission at very large wavelengths The unit chosen for measuring the monochromatic radiation is based on the fact that from a small area of a radiating surface the energy emitted is broadcast in all directions through any hemisphere centered on the radiation area The monochromatic radiation emitted in this manner from unit area in unit time divided by the wavelength ts called the monochromatic radiating power we The ordinates in fig 14.1 are values of we

Practical source of blackbody radiation No actual substance is a blackbody although some materials such as certain grades of carbon black do approach blackness An experimental equivalent of a blackbody is an isothermal enclosure containing a small peephole If a sight is taken through the peephole on the interior wall of the enclosure the effect is the same as viewing a blackbody The radiation emitted by the interior of the walls or admitted from outside through the peephole is completely absorbed after successive reflect tons and the overall absorptivity of the interior surface is unity

CHAPTER 14: Radiation Heat Transfer 421 Laws of blackbody radiation A basic relationship for blackbody radiation is the Stefan-Boltzmann law which states that the total emissive power of a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature or W,=oT* (14.5) where is a universal constant depending only upon the units used to measure J and we The Stefan-Boltzmann law is an exact consequence of the laws of thermody- name's and electromagnetism The distribution of energy in the spectrum of a blackbody is known accurately to is given by plank's law w Qahe7a 146 a = ThE it (14.6) where W,,, = monochromatic emissive power of blackbody h = planks constant c = speed of light 4 = wavelength of radiation k = Boltzmann's constant T = absolute temperature Equation (14.6) can be written was who = want of (14.7) where c and c are constants The units of the various quantities and magic dudes of the constants in else (14.5) and (14.6) are given in the list of symbols page 436.

CHAPTER id Radiation Heat Transfer 423 Kirchhoffâs law An important generalization concerning the radiating power of a substance is Kirchhoffâs law which states that at temperature equilibrium the ratio of the total radiating power of any body to its absorptivity depends only upon the temperature of the body thus consider any two bodies in temperature equilibrium with come on surroundings Kirchhoffâs law states that wow wow = (14.9) a a where we we = total radiating powers of two bodies a@,. i = absorptivities of two bodies This law applies to both monochromatic and total radiation to the first body referred to in end (14.9) is a blackbody we = i and is we = W,=--* (14.10) a where we denotes the total radiating power of a blackbody Thus Ms 441 a i i i we but by definition the emissivity of the second body e is We (14.12 6 = i a 4.12) we thus when any body is at temperature equilibrium with its surroundings its emissivity and absorptivity are equal This relationship may be taken as another statement of Kirchhoffâs law In general except for blackbodies or gray bodies absorptivity and emissivity are not equal if the body is not in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings The absorptivity and emissivity monochromatic or total of a blackbody are both unity The cosine Jaw also applies exactly to a blackbody as the reflectivity is zero for all wavelengths and all angles of incidence Kirchhoff's law applies to volumes as well as to surfaces Since absorption by an opaque solid is effectively confined to a thin layer at the surface the radiation emitted from the surface of the body originates in this same surface layer Radiating substances absorb their own radiation and radiation emitted by the material in the interior of the solid is also absorbed in the interior and does not reach the surface Because the energy distribution in the incident radiation depends upon the temperature and character of the originating surface the absorptivity of the receive in surface may also depend upon these properties of the originating surface Kirchhoffâs law does not therefore always apply to nonequilibrium radiation if however the receiving surface is gray a constant fraction independent of wavelength of the incident radiation is absorbed by the receiving surface and Kirchhoffâs law applies whether or not the two surfaces are at the same temperature

CHAPTER i Radiation Heat Transfer 425 Most surfaces however that emit radiation also receive radiation from other surfaces at different temperatures Some of this incoming radiation is absorbed and must be allowed for in determining the total flux of radiant energy For example a steam line in room ts surrounded by the walls floor and ceiling of the room all of which are radiating to the pipe and although the pipe loses more energy than it abs sorbs from its surroundings the net loss by radiation is less than that calculated from end (14.14). Even when a surface is radiating to a clear night sky the radiated energy is partially absorbed by the water and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and part of this absorbed energy is radiated back to the surface In furnaces and other high-temperature equipment where radiation is part circularly important the usual objective is to obtain a controlled rate of net heat exchange between one or more hot surfaces called sources and one or more cold surfaces called sivrks. In many cases the hot surface is a flame but exchange of energy between surfaces is common and a flame can be considered to be a special form of translucent surface The following treatment is limited to the radiant end orgy answer between opaque surfaces in the absence of any absorbing medium between them The simplest type of radiation between two surfaces occurs where each surface can see only the other for example where the surfaces are very large parallel planes as shown in fig 14.3a, and where both surfaces are black The energy emitted per unit area by the first plane is o tyg that emitted by the second plane is Hot surface FIGURE 14.3 Cold surface ope my Angle of vision in radiant heat flow Sea eon we ~ Hot surface Cold surface a for .

Actual engineering problems differ from this simple situation in the following ways (1) One or both of the surfaces of interest see other surfaces In fact an element of surface in a concave area sees a portion of its own surface (2) No actual surface is exactly black and the emissivities of the surfaces must often be considered Angle of vision qualitatively the interception of radiation from an area element of a surface by another surface of finite size can be visualized in terms of the angle of vision which is the solid angle subtended by the finite surface at the radiating elements The solid angle subtended by a hemisphere is 27 steradians (sr). This is the maximum angle of vision that can be subtended at any area element by a plane surface in sight of the elements It will be remembered that the total radiating power of an area element is defined to take this fact into account If the angle of vision is less than 27 sri only a fraction of the radiation from the area element will be intercepted by the receiving area and the remainder will pass on to be absorbed by other surfaces in sight of the remaining solid angle Some of the hemispherical angle of vision of an element of a concave surface is subtended by the originating surface itself Figure 14.3 shows several typical radiating surfaces Figure 14.3a shows how in two large parallel planes an area element on either plane is subtended by a solid angle of 27 so by the other The radiation from either plane cannot escape being intercepted by the other A point on the hot body of fig 14.36 sees only the cold surface and the angle of vision is again 27 sri Elements of the cold surface however see for the most part other portions of the cold surface and the angle of vision for the hot body is small This effect of self-absorption is also shown in fig 14.3Â¢. where the angle of vision of an element of the hot surface subtended by the cold surface is relatively small In fig 14.3d. the cold surface subtends a small angle at the hot surface and the bulk of the radiation from the hot surface passes on to some undetermined background Figure 14.3e shows a simple fur name with insulated refractory walls Radiation from the hot floor or source is in intercepted partly by the row of tubes across the top of the furnace w which form the sink and partly by the refractory walls and the refractory ceiling behind the tubes The refractory in such assemblies is assumed to absorb and emit energy at the same rate so the net energy effect at the refractory is zero The refractory ceiling absorbs the energy that passes between the tubes and reradiate it to the backs of the tubes Square-of-the-distance effect When energy from a small surface is intercepted by a large one the energy red lived per unit area of the receiving surface is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the surfaces as shown by the following discussion

RADIATION TO SEMITRANSPARENT MATERIALS Solids such as glass and clear plastic films are called semitransparent because they transmit only part of the energy they received Their transmissivity and absorptivity depend on the wavelength of the radiation and the thickness of the material The ability to absorb radiation can be characterized by an absorption coefficient i or an absorption length let The attenuation of the beam is assumed to be proportional to the intensity /,, which gives do â-â = uh (14.41) do where jig is the absorption coefficient for radiation of wavelength a and + is the dish dance from the receiving surface Integrating between limits gives I oh sere (14.42) for The absorption length is the value of x that makes the attenuation equal to idea which means ] 3 L=-- (14.43) a If the thickness of the material is much greater than let very little radiation is trash fitted and the material is considered opaque If the thickness is comparable to or smaller than let the material is said to be transparent or semitransparent Ordinary glass is transparent to visible light and to radiation of shorter wave lengths but is opaque to longer wavelengths This is the cause of the greenhouse effect in which the contents of a glass-walled enclosure become warmer than the surroundings when exposed to sunlight Much of the radiation from the sun's sure face at about 5,500 ka passes readily through the glass radiation from inside at say 30Â°C. is in the infrared region and is absorbed by the glass and partly reradiate back to the interior of the enclosure The interior temperature rises until convective losses equal the input of radiant energy As mentioned earlier a similar greenhouse effect affects the earth's climate ex kept that here the semitransparent medium is not glass but the earth's atmosphere

CHAPTER 15 Heat-Exchange Equipment In industrial processes heat energy is transferred by a variety of methods including conduction in electric-resistance heaters conduction-convection in exchangers boilers and condensers radiation in furnaces and radiant heat dryers and by sped dial methods such as dielectric heating Often the equipment operates under steady state conditions but in many processes it operates cyclically as in regenerative furnaces and agitated process vessels This chapter deals with equipment types that are of greatest interest to a process engineer tubular and plate exchangers extended-surface equipment mechanically aided heat-transfer devices condensers and vaporizers and packed-bed reactors or regenerator Evaporators are described in chap 16. Information on all types of heat-exchange equipment is given in engineering texts and handbooks.*"Â°7376"8 General design of heat-exchange equipment The design and testing of practical heat-exchange equipment are based on the general principles given in chaps 11 to 14. From material and energy balances the required heat-transfer rate is calculated then using the overall coefficient and the average at the required heat-transfer area is determined and in cyclic equip went the cycle time In simple devices these quantities can be evaluated easily and with considerable accuracy but in complex processing units the evaluation may be difficult and subject to considerable uncertainty The final design is nearly always a compromise based on engineering judgment to give the best overall performance in light of the service requirements Sometimes the design is governed by considerations that have little to do with heat transfer such as the space available for the equipment or the pressure drop that can be tolerated in the fluid streams Tubular exchangers are in general designed in accordance with various standards and codes such as the Standards of the Tubular Exchanger Manufacturers Association (TEMA)*â¢ and the ASME-API Unfired Pressure vessel code 440

CHAPTER 15: Heat-Exchange Equipment +41 In designing an exchanger many decisionsâsome of them arbitraryâmust be made to specify the materials of construction tube diameter tube length baffle spacing number of passes and so forth Compromises must also be made For example a high fluid velocity inside small tubes leads to improved heat-transfer cop efficient and a small required area but increases the friction losses and pumping costs The design of an individual exchanger may be optimized by a formal prove sure to balance the heat-transfer area and hence the price of the equipment and the fixed costs against the cost of energy to pump the fluids.?â In processing plants however the exchangers are components of a complex network of heat-transfer equipment and it is the network not the individual units that is optimized to give minimum investment and operating costs SHELL-AND-TUBE HEAT EXCHANGERS Tubular heat exchangers are so important and so widely used in the process induce tries that their design has been highly developed Standards devised and accepted by team are available covering in detail the materials methods of construction techs unique of design and dimensions for exchangers.*Â¢ The following sections describe the more important types of exchanger and cover the fundamentals of their engine needing design and operation Single-pass 1-1 exchanger The simple double-pipe exchanger shown in fig 11.3 is inadequate for low rates that cannot readily be handled in a few tubes If several double pipes are used in parallel the weight of metal required for the outer tubes becomes so large that the shell-and-tube construction such as that shown in fig 15.1, where one shell serves for many tubes is more economical This exchanger because it has one shel]-side pass and one tube-side pass is a 1-1 exchanger In an exchanger the shell-side and tube-side heat-transfer coefficients are of comparable importance and both must be large if a satisfactory overall coefficient is to be attained The velocity and turbulence of the shell-side liquid are as important as those of the tube-side fluid To promote crossbow and raise the average velocity of we eat real a her spa eat we I 1 " > A B do + Drain FIGURE 15.1 Single-pass 1-] counterblow heat exchanger a baffles be tubes c guide rods do do tube sheets i baffle spacers only two shown

Correlations for the outside film coefficient have been developed using the hydraulic diameter for the refolds and mussels numbers and allowing for the effects of baffle spacing and leakage around the tube bundle Flow across the rods leads to vortex formation and the coefficients for turbulent flow are about 1.5 times those predicted for the same refolds number using the Dittus-Boelter equation (Eq. (42.32)]. The coefficients are not as high as those for a segmentally baffled ex changer with close baffle spacing but the lower pressure drop and reduced vibration failure make the ROD baffle exchanger preferred for many applications Another design that requires no baffles uses tubes that are twisted into a helical shape with an oval cross section so that each tube is supported over its entire length by multiple contact points with adjacent tubes The end sections are kept circular to permit mounting in standard tube sheets The twisted tubes give improved heat transfer coefficients inside and outside because of greater turbulence and the de crease in required surface area may more than offset the higher cost per square foot This design eliminates tube vibration and may also reduce the rate of fouling."* With both the twisted tube and ROD baffle exchangers flow distribution on the shell side is a problem in large-diameter units With a single inlet pipe tubes near the inlet would get more than the average flow and those opposite the inlet would get little for for an appreciable distance down the exchanger Flow distribution is improved by enlarging the shell at the ends of the exchanger to make annular zones where fluid enters or leaves radially at lower velocity multiples exchangers The 1-1 exchanger has limitations because when the tube-side flow is divided evenly among all the tubes the velocity may be quite low giving a low heat-transfer

A common construction is the ]-2 parallel-counterflow exchanger in which the shell-side liquid flows in one pass and the tube-side liquid in two passes Such an exchanger is shown in fig 15.3. In multiples exchangers floating heads are frequently used and the bulge in the shell of the condenser in fig 11.1 and the stuffing box shown in fig 15.1 are unneces- say The tube-side liquid enters and leaves through the same head which is divided by a baffle to separate the entering and leaving tube-side streams The 1-2 exchanger is normally arranged so that the cold fluid and the hot fluid enter at the same end of the exchanger giving parallel flow in the first tube pass and counterblow in the second This permits a closer approach at the exit end of the exchanger than if the second pass were parallel all gad els . see of pS Sees | K my to it my it i we Ss | see we odd a i si FIGURE 15.3 A 1-2 parallel-counterflow exchanger

For Z = 1.0 and my = 0.5, fog = 0.80, and to drops rapidly with fur the increase in 74. When fog is less than 0.8, the exchanger should be redesigned with two shell passes or larger temperature differences otherwise the heat transfer surface is inefficiently used Although end (15.1) was derived for two tube passes the factor fa is almost the same for one shell pass and four six or any even number of tube passes so end (15.1) can be used for these cases When there are two shell passes and four tube passes as shown in fig 15.6b, the exchanger operates closer to countercurrent flow as illustrated by the fog factors in fig 15.6b.

The coefficient for the shell side he cannot be so easily calculated because the direction of flow is partly parole let to the tubes and partly across them and because the cross-sectional area of the stream and the mass velocity of the stream vary as the fluid crosses the tube bunk die back and forth across the shell also leakage between basics and shell and be tween baffles and tubes short-circuits some of the shell-side liquid and reduces the effectiveness of the exchanger An approximate but generally useful equation for . predicting shell-side coefficients is the Donohue equation (Eq. (15.6)], which is based on a weighted average mass velocity go of the fluid flowing parallel with the tubes and that flowing across the tubes The mass velocity go parallel with the tubes is the mass flow rate divided by the free area for flow in the baffle window so the baffle window is the portion of the shell cross section not occupied by the baftle.)

EXTENDED-SURFACE EQUIPMENT Difficult heat-exchange problems arise when one of two fluid streams has a much lower heat-transfer coefficient than the other A typical case is heating a fixed gas such as air by means of condensing steam The individual coefficient for the steam is typically 100 to 200 times that for the airstream consequently the overall coffin client is essentially equal to the individual coefficient for the air the capacity of a unit area of heating surface will be low and many meters or feet of tube will be red squired to provide reasonable capacity Other variations of the same problem are found in heating or cooling viscous liquids or in treating a stream of fluid at low Now rate because of the low rate of heat transfer in laminar flow To conserve space and to reduce the cost of the equipment in these cases certain types of heat-exchange surfaces called extended surfaces have been level oped in which the outside area of the tube is multiplied or extended by fins pegs disks and other appendages and the outside area in contact with the fluid thereby made much larger than the inside area The fluid stream having the lower coefficient is brought into contact with the extended surface and flows outside the tubes while the other fluid having the high coefficient flows through the tubes The quantity give effect of extending the outside surface can be seen from the overall coefficient written in the following form in which the resistance of the tube wall is neglected up et (15.17) vhf + a Achy

The internal pressure is the vapor pressure of the liquid at 7;. act ally there is a small temperature gradient inside the pipe because of the frictional pressure drop due to the vapor flow but the end-to-end difference is much less than (1, i the or (7; i T..). The pipes are set at a slight angle to the horizontal to facility take the return flow of the liquid and sometimes these are called gravity-assisted heat pipes or thermosiphon In other designs the pipes are vertical with the heated section at the bottom The advantages of heat pipes for energy recovery are reported to be low main penance easy cleaning and no air leakage compared with rotary or fixed-bed regenerator she pa 477). It might seem that the two-step process of transferring energy from the hot gas to an intermediate fluid and then to the cold gas would be less efficient than direct contact from hot to cold gas in a shell-and-tube or crossbow exchanger however on the hot end of the heat pipe the boiling coefficient is quite high and the overall coefficient is about the same as the outside film coefficient for the finned tube simp early at the cold end the overall coefficient is about the same as the outside coffin client because of the high value of the condensing coefficient Thus the total area is about the same as that for other types of gasbags exchangers In many other applications of heat pipes liquid is returned to the hot end by cap clarity or picking action as shown in fig 15.145. This permits the heat pipes to be used in any orientation and in spacecraft where there is no gravity Often the purpose is to dissipate heat from sensitive equipment such as computers or other electronic devices rather than to recover energy Heat pipes are relatively light in weight and have higher effective thermal conductivity than bars of aluminum or copper Small units may be square or rectangular in cross section with diameters of 1 my or less Many types of working fluids have been proposed for use in heat pipes include in water organic liquids liquefied gases and molten metals The principal red requirements are a reasonable vapor pressure over the operating temperature range good thermal conductivity low liquid and vapor viscosities, high surface tension and testability of the wick and wall material.*â Water is superior to most other like kids at 350 to 500 ka but alcohols are commonly used in space applications since water could freeze One of the largest installations of heat pipes is in Alaska. where thousands of heat pipes containing ammonia are used to prevent thawing of the per frost around the supports for the plasma oil pipeline SCRAPED-SURFACE EXCHANGERS Heat transfer to and from viscous liquids especially food products and other heat sensitive liquids is often accomplished in scraped-surface exchangers Typically these are double-pipe exchangers with a fairly large central tube 100 to 300 my

Scraped-surface devices for evaporating viscous liquids are described in chap 16. CONDENSERS AND VAPORIZERS As discussed in chaps i and 13, heat-transfer devices used to liquefy vapors by removing their latent heat are called condensers The latent heat is removed by abs sorbing it in a cooler liquid called the coolant Since the temperature of the coolant obviously is increased in a condenser the unit also acts as a heater but functionally it is the condensing action that is important and the name reflects this fact con denser fall into two classes In the first called shell-and-tube condensers the con denying vapor and coolant are separated by a tubular heat-transfer surface In the second called contact condensers the coolant and vapor streams both of which are usually water are physically mixed and leave the condenser as a single stream In industrial practice liquids are vaporized in kettle-type retailers or clan dries as discussed in chap 13. The heat of vaporization is most commonly supplied by condensing steam Shell-and-tube condensers The condenser shown in fig 11.1 is a single-pass unit since the entire stream of cooling liquid flows through all the tubes in parallel In large condensers this type of flow has a serious limitations The number of tubes is so large that in single pass flow the velocity through the tubes is too small to yield an adequate heat transfer coefficient and the unit is uneconomically large also because of the low

Provision for thermal expansion Because of the differences in temperature existing in condensers expansion strains may be set up that are sufficiently severe to buckle the tubes or pull them loose from the tube sheets The most common method of avoiding damage from expansion is the use of the floating-head con striction in which one of the tube sheets and therefore one end of the tubes is structurally independent of the shell This principle is used in the condenser of fig 15.15. The figure shows how the tubes may expand or contract independent of the shell A perforated plate is set over the vapor inlet to prevent cutting of the tubes by drops of liquid that may be carried by the vapor Dehumidifying condensers A condenser for mixtures of vapors and incondensable gases is shown in fig 15.16. It is set vertically not horizontally as are most condensers for vapor containing no incondensable gas also vapor is condensed inside the tubes not outside and the coolant flows through the shell This provides a positive sweep of the vapor-gas mixture through the tubes and avoids the formation of any stagnant pockets of inert gas that might blanket the heat-transfer surface The modified lower head acts to separate the condensate from the condensed vapor and gas

HEAT TRANSFER IN AGITATED VESSELS Heat-transfer surfaces which may be in the form of heating or cooling jackets or coils of pipe immersed in the liquid are often used in the agitated vessels described in chap 9. Heat-transfer coefficients In an agitated vessel as shown in chap i the dimensionless group dip is a refolds number useful in correlating data on power consumption This same group has been found to be satisfactory as a correlating variable for heat transfer to jackets or coils in an agitated tank The following equations are typical of those that have been offered for this purpose

The mixing caused by natural convection also makes the average temperature in the jacket close to that at the exit so the temper nature difference at the exit should be used for AT rather than the logarithmic mean Several methods can be used to increase the coefficient for liquid in the jacket The liquid can be introduced at high velocity through several nozzles all pointing in the same direction to induce swirling flow in the jacket fig 15. 18a).

Another approach is to weld a spiral baffle strip to the outside of the vessel before adding the jacket fig 15.185). The fluid then flows in a spiral path with a rectangular cross section and coefficients several times higher than those with an open jacket can be obtained however the gap between the baffle and the outer wall of the jacket leads to some leakage or bypass flow between loops which decreases the flow along the wall and the rate of heat transfer For higher jacket pressures and good control of the flow pattern the jacket may be formed by welding a half-pipe coil to the vessel outer wall see fig 15.1 8c).

476 SECTION 11: Heat Transfer and Its Applications than the surrounding gas The difference between gas and solid temperatures can be calculated by using correlations in chap | i this difference is generally only a few degrees compared to a typical driving force T i to of 20 to 30Â°C. The presence of solid particles makes the inside coefficient much greater than that for an empty tube at the same flow rate since the actual gas velocity between the particles is up to several times the superficial velocity For air in tubes packed with spheres the coefficients are 5 to 10 times those for an empty pipe The coffin clients increase with about the 0.6 power of the flow rate and decrease more with increasing tube size than for an empty tube The coefficients for a packed tube are highest when the ratio D,/D; is about 0.15 to 0.2, as shown by the results in fig 15.20. For very small particles the turbulent mixing in the bed is depressed and there is a large resistance to heat transfer in the central region which scads to a temperature profile similar to that for laminar flow For very large particles there is rapid mixing and almost no gradient in the center of the tube but there is a thick region of high void fraction near the wall most of the resistance to heat transfer is in this region in this case The dip in the curves at D,/D; * 0.3 was attributed to an increase in the void fraction.** To predict the rate of heat transfer for different particle and tube sizes gas flow rates and gas properties the coefficient i is split into two parts to account for the resistance in the region very near the wall and for the resistance in the rest of the packed bed total (15.33) my yer my 50 TIE | i | | 40 t â-4- ----4 of need | | to | 4 p ' | | = 30 i --â-boeeegesesbco up Set we | S o o 2.in. pipe | = 20 â+â-â 4-in, pipe Lo i < : in pipe | 10 to 4 all i | i 01 02 of of of 06 of 08 D,/0; FIGURE 15.20 Heat-transfer coefficients for tubes packed with alumina spheres airflow 3.000 lb/ft? oh (4.07 kg/m? -s).

When D,/D, is small the bed resistance is more important and increasing do increases red and /,,y. With large D,/D; the wall film controls and increasing do leads to a lower he and a lower he since as shown by end (15.36). he varies with do 3 Equation (15.36) was based on results for spheres but it gives a fairly good fit to the data for cylinders and ring-shaped packings.** For packed tubes operating at 200Â°C or higher radiation between particles and from the particles to the wall becomes significant and predicted overall coefficients should be corrected for this effect regenerator in a regenerator heat transfer between two streams is carried out by passing the hot and cold fluids alternately through a bed of solids which has appreciable heat storage capacity The hot fluid gives up heat to the solids which gradually get warmer but before equilibrium is reached the flows are switched and the cold fluid then removes heat from the bed In one type of regenerator two identical beds are used as in an adsorber-desorber system see fig 25.1.) A second type uses a rob taking bed in the shape of a thick wheel with cold fluid flowing axially through a sector usually 180Â°) of the bed and warm fluid flowing in the opposite direction

CHAPTER 16 Evaporation Heat transfer to a boiling liquid has been discussed generally in chap 13. A special case occurs so often that it is considered an individual operation It is called vapor ration and is the subject of this chapter The objective of evaporation is to concentrate a solution consisting of a none volatile solute and a volatile solvent In the overwhelming majority of evaporation the solvent is water Evaporation is conducted by vaporizing a portion of the solvent to produce a concentrated solution of thick liquor Evaporation differs from drying in that the residue is a liquidâsometimes a highly viscous oneârather than a solid it differs from distillation in that the vapor usually is a single component and even when the vapor is a mixture no attempt is made in the evaporation step to separate the vapor into fractions it differs from crystallization in that emphasis is placed on concentrating a solution rather than forming and building crystals In certain ritual tons for example in the evaporation of brine to produce common salt the line between evaporation and crystallization is far from sharp Evaporation sometimes produces a slurry of crystals in a saturated mother liquor In this book such pro messes are considered in chap 27, which is devoted to crystallization normally in evaporation the thick liquor is the valuable product and the vapor is condensed and discarded In one specific situation however the reverse is true Mineral-bearing water often is evaporated to give a solid-free product for boiler feed for special process requirements or for human consumption This technique is often called water distillation but technically it is evaporation Large-scale vapor ration processes have been developed and used for recovering potable water from seawater Here the condensed water is the desired product Only a fraction of the total water in the feed is recovered and the remainder is returned to the sea Liquid characteristics The practical solution of an evaporation problem is profoundly affected by the character of the liquor to be concentrated It is the wide variation in liquor 486

CHAPTER 16. Evaporation 487 characteristics which demands judgment and experience in designing and operate in evaporators that broadens this operation from simple heat transfer to a separate art Some of the most important properties of evaporating liquids are as follows concentration Although the thin liquor fed to an evaporator may be suffix gently dilute to have many of the physical properties of water as the concentration increases the solution becomes more and more individualistic The density and viscosity increase with solid content until either the solution becomes saturated or the hour becomes too viscous for adequate heat transfer Continued boiling of a saturated solution causes crystals to form these must be removed or the tubes clog The boiling point of the solution may also rise considerably as the solid content increases so that the boiling temperature of a concentrated solution may be much higher than that of water at the same pressure foaming Some materials especially organic substances foam during vapor ization. A stable foam accompanies the vapor out of the evaporator causing heavy entrainment Temperature sensitivity Many fine chemicals pharmaceutical products and foods are damaged when heated to moderate temperatures for relatively short times In concentrating such materials special techniques are needed to reduce both the temperature of the liquid and the time of heating sealed Some solutions deposit scale on the heating surface The overall coffin client then steadily diminishes until the evaporator must be shut down and the tubes cleaned Materials of construction Whenever possible evaporators are made of some kind of steel Many solutions however attack ferrous metals or are contaminated by them Special materials such as copper nickel stainless steel aluminum import virus graphite and lead are then used Since these materials are expensive high heat-transfer rates become especially desirable to minimize the first cost of the equipment Many other liquid characteristics must be considered by the designer of an evaporator Some of these are the specific heat heat of concentration freezing point gas liberation on boiling toxicity explosion hazards radioactivity and necessity for sterile operation Because of the variation in liquor properties many different evaporator designs have been developed The choice for any specific problem depends primarily on the characteristics of the liquid single and multiple-effect operation Most evaporators are heated by steam condensing on metal tubes Except in some special horizontal-tube evaporators,'Â° the material to be evaporated flows inside the tubes Usually the steam is at a low pressure below 3 at abs often the boiling liquid is under moderate vacuum at pressures down to about 0.05 at abs Reducing the boiling temperature of the liquid increases the temperature difference

The heat in the original steam is reused in the second effect and the evaporation achieved by a unit mass of steam fed to the first effect is approximately doubled Additional effects can be added in the same manner The general method of increasing the evaporation per kilogram of steam by using a series of evaporators between the steam supply and the condenser is called mutltiple-effect evaporation TYPES OF EVAPORATORS The chief types of steam-heated tubular evaporators are 1. longitude vertical evaporators a Upward flow (climbing-film) be Downward flow (falling-film) c Forced circulation 2. Agitated-film evaporators Once-through and circulation evaporators Evaporators may be operated either as once-through or as circulation units In once-through operation the feed liquor passes through the tubes only once releases the vapor and leaves the unit as thick liquor All the evaporation is accomplished in a single pass The ratio of evaporation to feed is limited in single-pass units thus these evaporators are well adapted to multiple-effect operation where the total amount of concentration can be spread over several effects Agitated-film evaporate tors are always operated once-through: falling-film and climbing-film evaporators can also be operated in this way Once-through evaporators are especially useful for heat-sensitive materials By operating under high vacuum the temperature of the liquid can be kept low With a single rapid passage through the tubes the thick liquor is at the evaporation temperature but a short time and can be quickly cooled as soon as it leaves the evaporator to circulation evaporators a pool of liquid is held within the equipment Incoming feed mixes with the liquid from the pool and the mixture passes through the tubes evaporated liquid discharged from the tubes returns to the pool so that only part of the total evaporation occurs in one pass All forced-circulation evaporators are operated in this way climbing-film evaporators are usually circus nation units

CHAPTER job Evaporation 489 The thick liquor from a circulation evaporator is withdrawn from the pool All the liquor in the poor must therefore be at the maximum concentration Since the liquid entering the tubes may contain several parts of thick liquor for each part of feed its viscosity is high and the heat-transfer coefficient tends to be low Circulation evaporators are not well suited to concentrating heat-sensitive liquids With a reasonably good vacuum the temperature of the bulk of the liquid may be none destructive but the liquid is repeatedly exposed to contact with hot tubes Some of the liquid therefore may be heated to an excessively high temperature Although the average residence time of the liquid in the heating zone may be short part of the liquid is retained in the evaporator for a considerable time Prolonged heating of even a small part of a heat-sensitive material such as a food can ruin the entire product Circulation evaporators however can operate over a wide range of concentrate on between feed and thick liquor in a single unit and are well adapted to single effect evaporation They may operate cither with natural circulation with the flow through the tubes induced by density differences or with forced circulation with flow provided by a pump longitude evaporators with upward flow A typical longitude vertical evaporator with upward flow of the liquid is shown in fig 16.la.

The tubes however are larger than those in a calandria: They are typically 25 to 50 my i to 2 in in diameter and 3 to 10 m (10 to 32 to long Dilute feed enters the system and mixes with the liquid draining from the separator Concentrated liquor is withdrawn from the bottom of the heater the remaining liquor is partially vaporized as it rises through the tubes The mixture of liquid and vapor from the top of the tubes flows into the separator where its velocity is greatly reduced To aid in eliminating liquid droplets the vapor impinges on and then passes around sets of baffle plates before leaving the separator The evaporator shown in fig 16.1a can be operated only as a circulation unit longitude vertical evaporators are especially effective in concentrating liquids that tend to foam Foam is broken when the high-velocity mixture of liquid and vapor impinges against the vapor-head baffled Falling-film evaporators Concentration of highly heat-sensitive materials such as fruit juices and milk requires a minimum time of exposure to a heated surface This can be done in once through falling-film evaporators in which the liquid enters at the top flows down stream inside the heated tubes as a film and leaves from the bottom The tubes are largest to 250 my i to 10 in in diameter Vapor evolved from the liquid is us ally carried downward with the liquid and leaves from the bottom of the unit In appearance these evaporators resemble long vertical tubular exchangers with a liquidâvapor separator at the bottom and a distributor for the liquid at the top The chief problem in a falling-film evaporator is that of distributing the liquid uniformly as a film inside the tubes This is done by a set of perforated metal plates above a carefully leveled tube sheet by inserts in the tube ends to cause the liquid to flow evenly into each tube or by spider distributors with radial arms from which the feed is sprayed at a steady rate on the inside surface of each tube full another way is to use an individual spray nozzle inside each tube When recirculation is allowable without damaging the liquid distribution of liquid to the tubes is facilitated by a moderate recycling of liquid to the tops of the tubes This provides a larger volume of flow through the tubes than is possible in once-through operation During evaporation the amount of liquid is continuously reduced as it flows downward and too great a reduction can lead to dry spots near the bottom of the tube Thus the amount of concentration that can be done in a sing glue pass is limited Falling-film evaporators with no recirculation and short resin dance times handle sensitive products that can be concentrated in no other way They are also well adapted to concentrating viscous liquids Forced-circulation evaporators In a natural-circulation evaporator the liquid enters the tubes at 0.3 to 1.2 mes i to 4 ft/s). The linear velocity increases greatly as vapor is formed in the tubes so

CHAPTER 16: Evaporation 491 that in general the rates of heat transfer are satisfactory With viscous liquids how ever the overall coefficient in a natural-circulation unit may be uneconomically low Higher coefficients are obtained in forced-circulation evaporators an example of which is shown in fig 16.16. Here a centrifugal pump forces liquid through the tubes at an entering velocity of 2 to 5.5 mes i to 18 ft/s). The tubes are under outfit client static head to ensure that there is no boiling in the tubes the liquid becomes superheated as the static head is reduced during flow from the heater to the vapor space and it flashes into a mixture of vapor and spray in the outlet fine from the exchanger just before entering the body of the evaporator The mixture of liquid and vapor impinges on a deflector plate in the vapor space Liquid returns to the pump inlet where it meets incoming feed vapor leaves the top of the evaporator body to a condenser or to the next effect Part of the liquid leaving the separator is continue oust withdrawn as concentrate In the design shown in fig 16.16 the exchanger has horizontal tubes and is two-pass on both tube and shell sides In others vertical single-pass exchangers are used In both types the heat-transfer coefficients are high especially with thin liquids but the greatest improvement over natural-circulation evaporation is seen with viscous liquids With thin liquids the improvement with forced circulation does not warrant the added pumping costs over natural circulation but with viscous material the added costs are justified especially when expensive metals must be used An example is caustic soda concentration which must be done in nickel equipment In multiple-effect evaporators producing a viscous final concentrate the first effects may be natural-circulation units and the later ones handling viscous like did forced-circulation units Because of the high velocities in a forced-circulation evaporator the residence time of the liquid in the tubes is shortâabout | to 3 so that moderately heat-sensitive liquids can be concentrated in them They are also effective in evaporating salting liquors or those that tend to foam Agitated-film evaporator The principal resistance to overall heat transfer from the steam to the boiling liquid in an evaporator is on the liquid side One way of reducing this resistance especially with viscous liquids is by mechanical agitation of the liquid film as in the evaporator shown in fig 16.2. This is a modified falling-film evaporator with a single jacketed tube containing an internal agitators Feed enters at the top of the jack ted section and is spread out into a think highly turbulent film by the vertical blades of the agitators Concentrate leaves from the bottom of the jacketed section vapor rises from the vaporizing zone into an jacketed separator which is somewhat larger in diameter than the evaporating tube In the separator the agitator blades throw entrained liquid outward against stationary vertical plates The droplets coalesce on these plates and return to the evaporating section Liquid-free vapor escapes through outlets at the top of the unit The chief advantage of an agitated-film evaporator is its ability to give high rates of heat transfer with viscous liquids The product may have a viscosity as high as 1,000 P at the evaporation temperature For moderately viscous liquids the heat transfer coefficient may be estimated from end (15.23). As in other evaporators the overall coefficient falls as the viscosity rises but in this design the decrease is slow

The temperature history of the liquor in the tubes is shown by lines arc and able in fig 16.4.

(11.37)], the overall resistance to heat transfer between the steam and the boiling liquid is the sum of five individual resistances the steam-film resistance the two scale resistances inside and outside the tubes the tube wall resistance and the resistance from the boiling liquid The overall coefficient is the reciprocal of the overall resistance In most evaporators the fouling factor of the condensing steam and the resistance of the tube wall are very small and they are us ally neglected in evaporator calculations In an agitated-film evaporator the tube wall is fairly thick so that its resistance may be a significant part of the total Steam-film coefficients The steam-film coefficient is characteristically high even when condensation is filmwise. Promoters are sometimes added to the steam to give dropline condensation and a still higher coefficient Since the presence of incondensable gas seriously reduces the steam-film coefficient provision must be made to vent noncondensables from the steam chest and to prevent leakage of air inward when the steam is at a pressure below atmospheric Liquid-side coefficients The liquid-side coefficient depends to a large extent on the velocity of the liquid over the heated surface In most evaporators and expel really those handling viscous materials the resistance of the liquid side controls the overall rate of heat transfer to the boiling liquid In natural-circulation evaporators the liquid-side coefficient for dilute aqueous solutions is between 1.500 and 3.000 womb c (250 and 500 Btu/ftâ-h- Â°F).

CHAPTER 16: Evaporation 507 kept constant by the operation of the process itself The concentration of the thick liquor can be changed only by changing the rate of flow of the feed If the thick liquor is too diluted the feed rate to the first effect is reduced and if the thick liquor is too concentrated the feed rate is increased Eventually the concentration in the last effect and in the thick-liquor discharge will reach a new steady state at the desired level The heating surface in the first effect will transmit per hour an amount of heat given by the equation i = auk at (16.9) If the part of this heat that goes to heat the feed to the boiling point is neglected for the moment it follows that practically all this heat must appear as latent heat in the vapor that leaves the first effect The temperature of the condensate leaving the second effect is very near the temperature i of the vapors from the boiling liquid in the first effect therefore in steady operation practically all the heat that was expended in creating vapor in the first effect must be given up when this same vapor condenses in the sect and effect The heat transmitted in the second effect however is given by the equation quiz = auk at (16.10) As has just been shown go and qi are nearly equal and therefore anus at = anus at (16.11) This same reasoning may be extended to show that roughly auk at = aye at = anus AT (16.12) It should be understood that else (16.11) and (16.12) are only approximate equations that must be corrected by the addition of terms which are however relax lively small compared to the quantities involved in the expressions above In ordinary practice the heating areas in all the effects of a multiple-effect evade orator are equal This is to obtain economy of construction therefore from end (16.12) it follows that since i = q = qi = i u at = at but it = 4 (16.13) From this it follows that the temperature drops in a multiple-effect evaporator are approximately inversely proportional to the heat-transfer coefficients EXAMPLE 16.3. A triple-effect evaporator is concentrating a liquid that has no apple cable elevation in boiling point The temperature of the steam to the first effect is 108Â°C, and the boiling point of the solution in the last effect is 52Â°C. The overall heat transfer coefficients in womb -Â°C, are 2,500 in the first effect 2.000 in the second effect and 1,500 in the third effect was the solution becomes more concentrated the viscosity increases and the overall coefficient is reduced At what temperatures will the liquid boil in the first and second effects solution The total temperature drop is 108 i 52 = 56Â°C. As shown by end (16.13), the temperature drops in the several effects will be approximately inversely proportional to

Consequently the boiling point in the first effect will be 108 i 14.3 = 93.7Â°C, and that in the second effect 758Â°C. Methods of feeding The usual method of feeding a multiple-effect evaporator is to pump the thin liquid into the first effect and send it in turn through the other effects as shown in fig 16.8a. This is called forward feed The concentration of the liquid increases from the first effect to the last This pattern of liquid flow is the simplest It requires a pump for feeding dilute solution to the first effect since this effect is often at about atmospheric pressure and a pump to remove thick liquor from the just effect The transfer from effect to effect however can be done without pumps since the flow is in the direction of decreasing pressure and control valves in the transfer line are all that is required Another common method is backward feed in which dilute liquid is fed to the last effect and then pumped through the successive effects to the first as shown in fig 16.8. This method requires a pump between each pair of effects in addition to the thick-liquor pump since the flow is from low pressure to high pressure Backward feed often gives a higher capacity than forward feed when the thick liquor is viscous but it may give a lower economy than forward feed when the feed liquor is cold Other patterns of feed are sometimes used In mixed feed the dilute liquid enters an intermediate effect flows in forward feed to the end of the series and is then pumped back to the first effects for final concentration as shown in fig 16.8c. This eliminates some of the pumps needed in backward feed and yet permits the final evaporation to be done at the highest temperature In crystallizing evaporators where a slurry of crystals and mother liquor is withdrawn feed may be admitted directly to each effect to give what is called parallel feed as shown in fig 16.8d. In parallel feed there is no transfer of liquid from one effect to another Capacity and economy of multiple-effect evaporators The increase in economy through the use of multiple-effect evaporation is obtained at the cost of reduced capacity It might be thought that by providing several times as much heating surface the evaporating capacity would be increased but this is not the case The total capacity of a multiple-effect evaporator is usually no greater than that of a single-effect evaporator having a heating surface equal to one of the effects and operating under the same terminal conditions and when there is an appreciable boiling-point elevation is often considerably smaller When the boiling-point elevation is negligible the effective overall AT equals the sum of the at in each effect and the amount of water evaporated per unit area of surface

The three diagrams in this figure represent the temperature drops in a single-effect, double-effect, and triple-effect evaporator The

S120 section this Heat Transfer and Its Applications The capacity of a double-effect evaporator concentrating a solution with a boiling point elevation is generally less than one-half the capacity of two single effects each operating with the same overall temperature drop The capacity of a triple effect is generally less than one-third that of three single effects with the same terminal temperatures Optimum number of effects The cost of each effect of an evaporator per square meter or square foot of surface is a function of its total area and decreases with area approaching an asymptote for very large installations Thus the investment required for an effect evaporator is about N times that for a single-effect evaporator of the same capacity The optimum number of effects must be found from an economic balance between the savings in steam obtained by multiple-cffect operation and the added investment required Multiple-effect calculations In designing a multiple-effect evaporator the results usually desired are the amount of steam consumed the area of the heating surface required the approximate temperatures in the various effects and the amount of vapor leaving the last effect As in a single-effect evaporator these quantities are found from material balances enthalpy balances and the capacity equation (16.1). In a multiple-effect evaporator however a trial-and-error method is used in place of a direct algebraic solution consider for example a triple-effect evaporator There are seven equations which may be written an enthalpy balance for each effect a capacity equation for each effect and the known total evaporation or the difference between the think and thick-liquor rates If the amount of heating surface in each effect is assumed to be the same there are seven unknowns in these equations (1) the rate of steam flow to the first effect (2) to (4) the rate of flow from each effect (5) the boiling temperature in the first effect (6) the boiling temperature in the second effect and (7) the heating surface per effect It is possible to solve these equations for the seven unknowns but the method is tedious and involved Another method of calculation is as follows 1. Assume values for the boiling temperatures in the first and second effects 2. From enthalpy balances find the rates of steam flow and of liquor from effect to effect 3. Calculate the heating surface needed in each effect from the capacity equations 4. If the heating areas so found are not nearly equal estimate new values for the boiling temperatures and repeat items 2 and 3 until the heating surfaces are equal In practice these calculations are done by computer Results of a typical calcium nation are shown in the following example EXAMPLE 16.4 A triple-effect forced-circulation evaporator is to be fed with 60.000 inch (27,215 kg/h) of 10% caustic soda solution at a temperature 180Â°F ($2.2Â°C}.

S3]4 SECTION 111: Heat Transfer and Its Applications VAPOR decompression The energy in the vapor evolved from a boiling solution can be used to vaporize more water provided there is a temperature drop for heat transfer in the desired direction In a multiple-effect evaporator this temperature drop is created by pro aggressively lowering the boiling point of the solution in a series of evaporators through the use of lower absolute pressures The desired driving force can also be obtained by increasing the pressure and therefore the condensing temperature of the evolved vapor by mechanical or thermal decompression The compressed vapor is then condensed in the steam chest of the evaporator from which it came Mechanical decompression The principle of mechanical vapor decompression is illustrated in fig 16.10. Cold feed is preheated almost to its boiling point by exchange with hot liquor and is pumped through a heater as in a conventional forced-circulation evaporator The vapor evolved however is not condensed instead it is compressed to a somewhat higher pressure by a positive-displacement or centrifugal compressor and becomes the steam which is fed to the heater Since the saturation temperature of the come pressed vapor is higher than the boiling point of the feed heat flows from the vapor to = Compressor /_\ \ / Motor or turbine | my i my Thick liquor discharge Makeup stern i []~â Feed heater i Condensate Cirevlati 4 to curating pump part to of to FIGURE 16.10 Mechanical decompression applied to forced-circulation evaporator

CHAPTER 16: Evaporation 545 the solution generating more vapor A small amount of makeup steam may be necessary The optimum temperature drop for a typical system is about 5Â°C. The energy utilization of such a system is very good Based on the steam equivalent of the power required to drive the compressor the economy corresponds to that of an evade orator containing 10 to ja effects Important applications of mechanical compression evaporation include production of distilled water from seawater evaporation of black liquor in the paper industry evaporation of heat-sensitive materials such as fruit juices and crystallization of salts having inverted solubility curves see chap 27). Falling-film evaporators are especially well suited for operation with vapor decompression systems i Thermal decompression In a thermal decompression system the vapor is compressed by acting on it with high-pressure steam in a jet ejector This results in more steam than is needed for boiling the solution so that excess steam must be vented or condensed The ratio of motive steam to the vapor from the solution depends on the evaporation pressure for many low-temperature operations with steam at 8 to 10 at pressure the ratio of steam required to the mass of water evaporated is about 0.5. Since steam jets can handle large volumes of low-density vapor thermal decompression is better suited than mechanical decompression to vacuum evaporate tiny Jets are cheaper and easier to maintain than blowers and compressors The chief disadvantages of thermal decompression are the low efficiency of the jets and lack of flexibility in the system toward changed operating conditions SYMBOLS A Area of heat-transfer surface my or to aye as aye in effects i i i be _ Boiling-point elevation c or of i Specific heat at constant pressure J/g-Â°C or Btu/lb.Â°F: C,,,, of feed H Enthalpy of thick liquor jog or Btu/lb; he of condensate he of feed //,. of saturated steam 47,,, of vapor or superheated steam it Mass flow rate ugh or Ib/h; of liquor leaving single-effect evaporator nice of feed my of steam and steam condensate N Number of evaporator effects p pressure at or i /ft?; put of steam put put pya in vapor spaces of effects 11, 141 q Rate of heat transfer W or Btu/h; are total rate get to thin liquor get from steam q,., for vaporization get get gas in effects i tie HI T temperature c or of boiling temperature in and of liquor leaving single-effect evaporator the temperature of condensate the of feed 7). of entering steam the of saturated steam 7â. boiling temperature of water at pressure of vapor space the the the boiling temperature in and of liquor leaving effects to i TIT U Overall heat-transfer coefficient womb doc or Btu/ft?-b-Â°F, U,;. us up in effects tits the

, SECTION i Mass Transfer and Its Applications A group of operations for separating the components of mixtures is based on the transfer of material from one homogeneous phase to another Unlike purely me chemical separations these methods utilize differences in vapor pressure solubility or diffusivity not density or particle size The driving force for transfer is a concent ration difference or a difference in activity much as a temperature difference or a temperature gradient provides the driving force for heat transfer These methods covered by the term mass-transfer operations include such techniques as distilled tiny gas absorption dehumidification adsorption liquid extraction leaching cross tallization, membrane separations and a number of others not discussed in this book The function of distillation is to separate by vaporization a liquid mixture of miscible and volatile substances into individual components or in some cases into groups of components The separation of a mixture of alcohol and water into its components that of liquid air into nitrogen oxygen and argon and that of crude petroleum into gasoline kerosene fuel oil and lubricating stock are examples of distillation . In gas absorption a solute gas is absorbed from an inert gas into a liquid in which the solute is more or less soluble The washing of ammonia from a mixture of ammonia and air by means of liquid water is a typical example The solute is subset quietly recovered from the liquid by distillation and the absorbing liquid can be either discarded or reused When a solute is transferred from the solvent liquid to the gas phase the operation is known as desorption or stripping In dehumidification a pure liquid is partially removed from an inert or carrier gas by condensation us ally the carrier gas is virtually insoluble in the liquid Removal of water vapor from air by condensation on a cold surface and the condensation of an organic vapor such as carbon tetrachloride out of a stream of nitrogen are examples of dehumidifica- tiny In humidification operations the direction of transfer is from the liquid to the gas phase In the drying of solids a liquid usually water is separated by the use of hot dry gas usually air and so is coupled with the humidification of the gas phase 321

SECTION ivy Mass Transfer and ts Applications In membrane separations including gas separations reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration, one component of a liquid or gaseous mixture passes through a sell active membrane more readily than the other components The fundamental driving force is the difference in thermodynamic activity but in many cases the driving force can be expressed as a difference in concentration or partial pressure In adsorption a solute is removed from either a liquid or a gas through contact with a solid adsorbent the surface of which has a special affinity for the solute In liquid extraction sometimes called solvent extraction a mixture of two components is treated by a solvent that preferentially dissolves one or more of the components in the mixture The mixture so treated is called the raffinate and the solvent-rich phase is called the extract The component transferred from raffinate to extract is the soured and the component left behind in the raffinate is the diluent The solvent in the extract leaving the extractor is usually recovered and reused In extraction of solids or teaching soluble material is dissolved from its mixture with an inert solid by means of a liquid solvent The dissolved material or solute can then be recovered by crystallization or evaporation Crystallization is used to obtain materials in attractive and uniform crystals of good purity separating a solute from a melt or a solution and leaving impurities behind The quantitative treatment of mass transfer is based on material and energy balances equilibria and rates of heat and mass transfer Certain concepts applicant be generally are discussed here The individual operations are discussed in the following chapters TERMINOLOGY AND SYMBOLS It is convenient to refer generally to the two streams in any one operation as the L phase and the V phase It is also customary to choose the stream having the higher density as the L phase and the one having the lower density as the V phase An exception may appear in liquid extraction where the raffinate always is taken as the L phase and the extract as the V phase even when the raffinate happens to be lighter than the extract In drying the L phase is the stream consisting of the solid and the liquid retained in or on the solid Table A shows how the streams are designated in the various operations Note on concentrations Strictly speaking concentration means mass per unit volume Mass may be in kilograms or pounds and volume in cubic meters or cubic feet Kilogram moles or pound moles are often used as a measure of the amount of solute present In this book the context will make clear what quantityâmole or ordinary masses used It is sometimes convenient to express concentrations in mole or mass fractions The mole fraction is the ratio of the moles of the component to the total number of moles in the mixture with a corresponding definition for mass fraction By definition all mole or mass fractions in a mixture sum to unity If there are r components r i | of the mole fractions may be chosen independently the mole fraction of the remaining component is thereby fixed and equals | less the sum of the others

CHAPTER 17 Principles of Diffusion and Mass Transfer Between Phases Diffusion is the movement under the influence of a physical stimulus of an individ- pal component through a mixture The most common cause of diffusion is a con generation gradient of the diffusing component A concentration gradient tends to move the component in such a direction as to equalize concentrations and destroy the gradient When the gradient is maintained by constantly supplying the diffusing component to the high-concentration end of the gradient and removing it at the low-concentration end there is a steady-state flux of the diffusing component This is characteristic of many mass-transfer operations For example when ammonia is removed from a gas by absorption in water in a packed column at each point in the column a concentration gradient in the gas phase causes ammonia to diffuse to the gas-liquid interface where it dissolves and a gradient in the liquid phase causes it to diffuse into the bulk liquid In stripping a solute from a liquid the gradients are reversed here diffusion brings solute from the bulk liquid to the interface and from there into the gas phase In some other mass-transfer operations such as leaching and adsorption unsteady-state diffusion takes place and the gradients and fluxes decrease with time as equilibrium is approached Although the usual cause of diffusion is a concentration gradient diffusion can also be caused by an activity gradient as in reverse osmosis by a pressure gradient by a temperature gradient or by the application of an external force field as in a centrifuge Molecular diffusion induced by temperature is thermal diffusion and that from an external field is forced diffusion Both are uncommon in chemical engine needing Only diffusion under a concentration gradient is considered in this chapter Diffusion is not restricted to molecular transfer through stagnant layers of solid or fluid It also takes place when fluids of different compositions are mixed The first step in mixing is often mass transfer caused by the eddy motion characteristic of turbulent flow This is called eddy diffusion The second step is molecular diffusion between and inside the very small eddies Sometimes the diffusion process is accord panned by bulk flow of the mixture in a direction parallel to the direction of diffusion 527

Differences between heat transfer and mass transfer result from the fact that heat is not a substance but energy in transit whereas diffusion is the physical flow of material furthermore all molecules of a mixture are at the same temperature at a given point in space so heat transfer in a given direction is based on one temperature gradient and the average thermal conductivity With mass answer there are different concentration gradients for each component and often different diffusivities. denoted by using identifying subscripts for i and do The material nature of diffusion and the resulting flow lead to four types of situations 1. Only one component A of the mixture is transferred to or from the interface and the total Row is the same as the flow of a Absorption of a single component from a gas into a liquid is an example of this type 2. The diffusion of component A in a mixture is balanced by an equal and opposite molar flow of component be so that there is no net molar flow This is generally the case in distillation and it means there is no net volume flow in the gas phase There is generally a net volume flow or mass flow in the liquid phase because of the difference in the molar densities but this flow is small and can be neglected 3. Diffusion of A and B takes place in opposite directions but the molar fluxes are unequal This situation often occurs in diffusion of chemically reacting note that for momentum transfer by convention the negative sign is often omitted

The concentration gradient for one-way diffusion is not linear but is steeper at low values of you as shown in fig 17.18. The gradient for component B can be obtained directly from the gradient for a since ya + ya = 1.0 or my + cog = pya There is no transfer of B toward the interface in spite of the large concentration grab diet shown in fig 17.1b. The explanation is that B tends to diffuse toward the red lion of lower concentration but the diffusion flux is just matched by the convective flow carrying B in the opposite direction EXAMPLE 17.1. a For the diffusion of solute A through a layer of gas to an absorbing liquid with ya = 0.20 and you = 0.10, calculate the transfer rate for one-way diffusion compared to that for equivocal diffusion be What is the value of ya halfway through the layer for one-way diffusion

PREDICTION OF DIFFUSIVITIES Diffusivities are best estimated by experimental measurements and where such information is available for the system of interest it should be used directly Often the desired values are not available however and they must be estimated from published correlations Sometimes a value is available for one set of conditions of temperature and pressure the correlations are then useful in predicting from the known value the desired values for other conditions Diffusion in gases Values of do for some common gases diffusing in air at of and | at are given in happy 18.

Ja ka = ââ_ 17.43 ppm of ka we Then ka tS 17.44 up it (17.44) The significance of ka is brought out by combining end (17.39) with end (17.20) for steady-state equivocal diffusion in a stagnant film This gives J Dy(Cai i can 1 ka 4 = et can i a be can i a = 2 (17.45) = i . Thus the coefficient ka is the molecular diffusivity divided by the thickness of the stagnant layer When we are dealing with unsteady-state diffusion or diffusion in flowing streams end (17.45) can still be used to give an effective film thickness from known values of ka and do Film Theory The basic concept of the film theory is that the resistance to diffusion can be con ordered equivalent to that in a stagnant film of a certain thickness The implication is that the coefficient ka varies with the first power of do which is rarely true but this does not detract from the value of the theory in many applications The film the or is often used as a basis for complex problems of multicomponent diffusion or diffusion plus chemical reaction For example consider mass transfer from a turbulent gas stream to the wall of a pipe with the concentration gradient as shown in fig 17.2. There is a laminar layer near the wall where mass transfer is mainly by molecular diffusion and the concentration gradient is almost linear As the distance from the wall increases turbulence becomes stronger and the eddy diffusivity increases which means that FIGURE 17.2 - Bite Concentration gradient for mass transfer in a pipe with Calms i turbulent flow of gas Car

CHAPTER 17: Principles of Diffusion and Mass transfer Between Phases 545 Boundary Layer Theory Although there are few examples of diffusion through a stagnant fluid film mass transfer often takes place in a thin boundary layer near a surface where the fluid is in laminar flow If the velocity gradient in the boundary layer is linear and the velocity is zero at the surface the equations for flow and diffusion can be solved to give the concentration gradient and the average mass-transfer coefficient The coefficient depends on the two-thirds power of the diffusivity and decreases with increasing dish dance along the surface in the direction of flow because an increase either in distance or in do makes the concentration gradient extend farther from the surface which decreases the gradient dc,/db at the surface For flow over a flat plate or around a cylinder or sphere the velocity profile is linear near the surface but the gradient decreases as the velocity approaches that of the main stream at the outer edge of the boundary layer Exact calculations show that the mass-transfer coefficient still varies with my if do is low or the schist number jÂ¢/oD, is 10 or larger For schist numbers of about i typical for gases the predicted coefficient varies with a slightly lower power of do For boundary layer flows no matter what the shape of the velocity profile or value of the physical properties the transfer rate cannot increase with the 1.0 power of the diffusivity as implied by the film theory Boundary layer theory can be used to estimate i for some situations but when the boundary layer becomes turbulent or separation occurs exact predictions of i cannot be made and the theory serves mainly as a guide in developing empirical correlations The analogy between heat and mass transfer in boundary layers permits correlations developed for heat transfer to be used for mass transfer For example the average coefficient for mass transfer through a laminar boundary layer on a flat plate is obtained from end (12.10) by replacing Nu with Sh and or with so sh = few 0.664(Sc)'7(Re, 730) do where b is the total length of the plate For laminar flow in tubes else (12.17) and (12.18) can be used for mass trash fer with get = m/pD,.L or (11 /4)ReSc( D/L).

For my = 10-5 comes and i = 10 so the depth of penetration is only 0.036 my In gas absorption equipment drops and bubbles often have very short lifetimes because of coalescence and the penes ration theory is likely to apply ; An alternate form of the penetration theory was developed by Danckwerts, who considered the case where elements of fluid at a transfer surface are randomly replaced by fresh fluid from the bulk stream An exponential distribution of ages or contact times results and the average transfer coefficient is given by ka kids (17.55) where s is the fractional rate of surface renewal in s7!. Both else (17.54) and (17.55) predict that the coefficient varies with the one half power of the diffusivity and give almost the same value for a given average contact time A modified version of the penetration theory's which assumes that eddies from a turbulent bulk fluid come to within random distances of the surface gives slightly higher exponents for the diffusivity which indicates that this theory might apply for mass transfer to pipe walls or flat surfaces such as a pool of liquid The various forms of the penetration theory can be classified as surface renewal models implying either formation of new surface at frequent intervals or replace went of fluid elements at the surface with fresh fluid from the bulk The time to and its reciprocal the average rate of renewal are functions of the fluid velocity the fluid properties and the geometry of the system and can be accurately predicted in only a few special cases however even if fa must be determined empirically the surface renewal models give a sound basis for correlation of mass-transfer data in many

CHAPTER 17: Principles of Diffusion and Mass Transfer Between Phases 547 situations particularly for transfer to drops and bubbles The similarity between else (17.54) and (15.23) is an example of the close analogy between heat and mass transfer It is often reasonable to assume that fa is the same for both processes and thus to estimate rates of heat transfer from measured mass-transfer rates or vice versus Two-Film Theory In many separation processes material must diffuse from one phase into another phase and the rates of diffusion in both phases affect the overall rate of mass trash fer In the two-film theory proposed by Whitmanâ* in 1923, equilibrium is assumed at the interface and the resistances to mass transfer in the two phases are added to gel an overall resistance just as is done for heat transfer The reciprocal of the over all resistance is an overall coefficient which is easier to use for design calculations than the individual coefficients What makes mass transfer between phases more complex than heat transfer is the discontinuity at the interface which occurs because the concentration or mole fraction of diffusing solute is hardly ever the same on opposite sides of the interface For example in destination of a binary mixture v ts greater than xu and the gradin ends near the surface of a bubble might be as shown in fig 17.3a. For the absorb ton of a very soluble gas the mole fraction in the liquid at the interface would be greater than that in the gas as shown in fig 17.30.

For some problems such as answer through a stagnant film into a phase where the penetration theory is thought to apply the penetration theory coefficient is slightly changed because of the varying concentration at the interface but this effect is only of academic interest The essential part of the two-film theory is the method of allowing for the part ton of solute between phases at the interface while combining individual coefficients to get an overall coefficient This approach is used in the analysis of laboratory data and in equipment design for many types of mass-transfer operations including abs sorption adsorption extraction and distillation The same principle of adding resist dances with the appropriate distribution factors also applies to membrane separate tons in which there are three resistances in series

The coefficient & has been studied in experimental devices in which the area of contact between phases is known and where boundary layer separation does not take place The wetted-wall tower shown in fig 17.5, which is sometimes used in practice is one device of this type It has given valuable information on mass transfer to and from fluids in turbulent flow A wetted-wall tower is essentially a vertical tube with means for admitting liquid at the top and causing it to flow Gas in or out FIGURE 17.5 Wetted-wall tower of fa Calming section in + darn N we | are Gauze weir = ~<â liquid in peer of ay TS we / i Wetted-wall ! section | 1 | of S end i of liquid out ~<âââ A a Z Y i .

Mass transfer to liquids in turbulent pipe flow has been studied by using tubes made from a slightly soluble solid and measuring the rate of dissolution of the solid for various liquid flow rates An alternate technique is to make a portion of the tube wall an electrode and carry out an electrochemical reduction under conditions where the current is limited by the rate of mass transfer of the reacting ion to the wall 3. External mass transfer such as diffusion to particles or to the outside of pipes or cylinders requires different correlations from those for internal mass transfer because there is boundary layer flow over part of the surface and boundary layer separation is common The mass-transfer coefficients can be determined by studying evaporation of liquid from porous wet solids however it is not easy to ensure that there is no effect of internal mass-transfer resistance Complications from diffusion in the solid are eliminated if the solid is made from a slightly sold able substance that dissolves in the liquid or sublimes into a gas This method also permits measurement of local mass-transfer coefficients for different points on the solid particle or cylinder 4. finally experiments are made with actual mass-transfer devices such as packed towers sieve trays and bubble columns for which the mass-transfer area varies with operating conditions The mass-transfer rates are converted first to a value metric mass-transfer coefficient ka where a is the transfer area per unit volume of equipment Sometimes a is determined from photographs so that separate correlate tons for a and k can be developed Although there are two fluid phases present in most cases the resistance in one phase is usually made negligible so that ka for the other phase can be determined For example gas-film coefficients in a packed cold um are determined by evaporating pure liquids into flowing gases and there is no diffusion resistance in the liquid Likewise the absorption of a pure gas into water eliminates the gas-film resistance permitting study of the liquid-film coefficient Experiments conducted for obtaining numerical values for & or ka consist of measuring experimentally the quantities not a ya and y and calculating k by end (17.40) or (17.49) or an integrated form of these equations as shown in chap 18. If A or a is not known the total volume of the equipment is used and ka calculated Dimensional analysis is used to plan the experiments and to interpret the results in the form of dimensionless groups and equations Analogies among rich tiny heat transfer and mass transfer are useful guides Coefficients for Mass Transfer Through Known Areas In this section correlations are given for mass transfer between fluids or between fluids and solids where the area A is known Coefficients for equipment in which the area between the phases is not known are discussed in subsequent chapters

CHAPTER 37: Principles of Diffusion and Mass transfer Between Phases 551 Dimensional Analysis From the mechanism of mass transfer it can be expected that the coefficient k would depend on the diffusivity do and on the variables that control the character of the fluid flow namely the velocity we the viscosity i the density pa and some linear dimension do Since the shape of the interface can be expected to influence the process a different relation should appear for each shape For any given shape of transfer surface ka W(D,, did not Dimensional analysis gives kid DG x . i =y(â. i (17.62) do be do where G = up The dimensionless group k-D/D, is called the sourwood number and is de noted by she The other groups are of course the refolds number Re = DG/je and the schist number so = yz/(pD,). When the mass-transfer coefficient depends on the two-thirds power of the if fusivity, as is the case for some boundary layer flows the coefficients are often presented in the form of a ja factor analogous to the job factor of end (12.53): yak why (17.63) a ppm , Mass transfer with flow inside pipes Correlations for mass transfer to the inside wall of a pipe are of the same form as those for heat transfer since the basic equations for diffusion and conduction are similar For laminar flow the sourwood number shows the same trends as the mussels number with a limiting value of 3.66 for a constant wall concentration and a one-third dependence on flow rate for short tubes When the walk concentration is a function of axial position as in a counterblow membrane separator the limit in sourwood number is somewhat higher than for a constant concentration at the wall see fig 12.2), but there may be little difference with high great numbers get The recommended equation for moderate Graetz, numbers is the theoretical equation Sh = 1.62 Gz"?

The term w/u'4 is usually about 1.0 for mass transfer and is omitted i = u = 4 f = 0.023 red (17.67) The analogy shown in this equation is general for heat and mass transfer in the same equipment Extending the analogy to include friction loss is possible for pipes only because all the loss comes from skin friction The analogy does not apply to total friction loss when there is form drag from separation of flow as occurs in flow around objects In general job is a function of red For gas-phase mass transfer other forms of job can be used kart 5 am a my = scan = 2 scan (17.68 am up G } am P i = to so (17.69) dm G Coefficient ka is discussed in chap 18.

SOS (17.71) The difference between the exponent on the schist number and the usual value of t may not be significant but the exponent for the refolds number is definitely greater than 0.80. Other studies of heat transfer with large prandial numbers have also shown an exponent of about 0.9 for the refolds number Various empirical equations that cover the entire range of so or or with good accuracy are available

The following empirical equation for external mass transfer was developed from data for oxygen removal from water using radial flow modules with close packed hollow fibers Sh = 1.28 real so (17.74)

CHAPTER 17: Principles of Diffusion and Mass Transfer Between Phases 555 Flow past single spheres For mass transfer to an isolated sphere the sourwood number approaches a lower limit of 2.0 as the refolds number approaches zero A simple equation that is fairly accurate for refolds numbers up to 1,000 is a modification of the FrÃ©ssling equation compare to end (12.64) for nuts Sh = 2.0+0.6 real scan (17.78) Data for high refolds numbers show a gradual increase of slope on a plot of Sh versus red as shown in fig 17.7. The exponent of i is consistent with boundary layer theory which applies to the front portion of the sphere where most of the transfer takes place at moderate refolds numbers At high refolds numbers mass transfer in the turbulent region becomes more important and the effect of flow rate increases The correlation in fig 17.7 gives values that are too low for creeping flower where the refolds number is low and the pellet number Pe is high ape = Re x so = D,Mlo/ D,,). For this case the recommended equation is Sh = (4.0 + 1.21 Pe??)!â (17.76) The limiting sourwood number of 2.0 corresponds to an effective film thickness of D,/2 if the mass-transfer area is taken as the external area of the sphere The con generation gradients actually extend out to infinity in this case but the mass-transfer area also increases with distance from the surface so the effective film thickness is much less than might be estimated from the shape of the concentration profile 3 i 0 eat we is or he to et rat tit HL to to i evil fret to | i up Packed beds | i i elf 10? beta of 13 pen for ass we = 10Â° a we i it to to TA e far 3 for let Hi of it iT Tat it a eT oil oh ate faiycly. to see er I | 10 it is we we resets es does teeth verse up wait is oo are Coat I to it i my pig eat up | sate asymptote stagnant fluid all i tit Y i 1 10 10? 103 104 105 DG f a 2/3 ts FIGURE 17.7 Heat and mass transfer flow past single spheres solid line and in packed beds dashed lines

so SECTION ivy Mass Transfer and Its Applications Mass transfer in packed beds There have been a great many studies of mass transfer and heat transfer from gases or liquids to particles in packed beds The coefficients increase with about the square root of the mass velocity and the two-thirds power of the diffusivity but the correlations presented by different workers differ appreciably in contrast to the close agreement found in studies of single spheres An equation that fairly well represents most of the data is 0415 i = we got = 117( 222) (17.77) Ho of This is equivalent to the equation Sh = 1.17 red sell (17.78) Equations (17.77) and (17.78) are recommended for spheres or roughly sphere can solid particles that form a bed with about 40 to 45 percent voids For cylindrical particles these equations can be used with the diameter of the cylinder in Re and she For beds with higher void fractions or for hollow particles such as rings other correlations are available To compare mass transfer in packed beds with transfer to a single particles sourwood numbers calculated from end (17.78) are plotted in fig 17.7 along with the correlation for isolated spheres The coefficients for packed beds are 2 to 3 times those for a single sphere at the same refolds number Most of this difference is due to the higher actual mass velocity in the packed bed The refolds number is based for convenience on the superficial velocity but the average mass velocity is get and the local velocity at some points in the bed is even higher Note that the dashed lines in fig 17.7 are not extended to low values of red since it is unlikely that the coefficients for a packed bed would ever be lower than those for single particles Therefore else (17.77) and (17.78) should not be used for refolds numb bars less than about 10. Mass transfer to suspended particles When solid particles are suspended in an agitated liquid as in a stirred tank a minimum estimate of the transfer coefficient can be obtained by using the terminal velocity of the particle in still liquid to calculate Re in end (17.75). The effect of particle size and density difference on this minimum coefficient &,; is shown in fig 17.8. Over a wide range of sizes there is little change in the coefficient be cause the increase in terminal velocity and refolds number makes the sourwood number nearly proportional to particle diameter The actual coefficient is greater than kid because frequent acceleration and de celebration of the particle raises the average slip velocity and because small eddies in the turbulent liquid penetrate close to the particle surface and increase the local rate of mass transfer however if the particles are fully suspended the ratio &./k., falls within the relatively narrow range of 1.5 to 5 for a wide range of particle sizes and agitation conditions.'Â® The effects of particle size diffusivity and viscosity follow the trends predicted for k,,. but the density difference has almost no effect until it

Power per unit volume is a satisfactory basis for scale when we are dealing with suspended particles provided geometric similarity is maintained Mass transfer to drops and bubbles When small drops of liquid are falling through a gas surface tension tends to make the drops nearly spherical and the coefficients for mass transfer to the drop surface are often quite close to those for solid spheres The shear caused by the quid moving past the drop surface however sets up toroidal circulation currents in the drop that decrease the resistance to mass transfer both inside and outside the drop The extent of the change depends on the ratio of the viscidities of the internal and external fluids and on the presence or absence of substances such as surfactants that concentrate at the interface."' For a low-viscosity drop falling through a viscous liquid with no surface-active material present the velocity boundary layer in the external fluid almost disappears Fluid elements are exposed to the drop for short times and the mass transfer is

Coefficients in agreement with end (17.79) have been found for some drops in free fall but in many cases the high drop viscosity or impurities in the drop reduce the circulation currents and lead to values only slightly greater than those for rigid spheres For drops suspended in an agitated liquid as in a stirred-tank extractor the coefficients generally fall between those for a solid sphere and those for a completely circulating drop The coefficients for drops increase with the 1.0 to 1.2 power of the stirrer speed in contrast to the 0.4 to 0.5 power found with solid part titles because eddies in the suspending liquid can penetrate closer to a drop with a deformable surface than to a solid particles It is difficult to predict ka for a practical application and the mass-transfer calculations are generally based on a volumetric mass-transfer coefficient ka stir mated from laboratory or pilot-plant tests The same uncertainties arise when we are dealing with mass transfer from bubbles of gas rising through liquid The gas in the bubbles should circulate rapidly because of the low gas viscosity but impurities often interfere giving coefficients between those for rigid spheres and those for freely circulating bubbles Bubbles 1 my in diameter or smaller often behave as rigid spheres and those 2 my or larger as freely circulating bubbles Bubbles larger than a few millimeters in diameter however are flattened in shape and may oscillate as they rise making mass-transfer predictions more difficult As with transfer to liquid drops design correlations for bubbling systems are usually based on a volumetric coefficient With drops and bubbles the resistance to mass transfer in both phases may be significant Diffusion inside a stagnant (noncirculating) drop is an unsteady-state process and egg (17.38) could be applied however the surface concentration is usually changing because the drop or bubble is moving through the equipment For convenience in combining the internal and external resistances an effective internal coefficient can be used as was done for heat transfer to spheres see page 315). we = 10D.

CHAPTER 18 Gas Absorption This chapter deals with the mass-transfer operations known as gas absorption and stripping or desorption In gas absorption a soluble vapor is absorbed from its mix sure with an inert gas by means of a liquid in which the solute gas is more or less soluble A major application of absorption technology is the removal of cop and his from natural gas or synthesis gas by absorption in solutions of amines or alkaline salts Another example is the washing of ammonia from a mixture of ammonia and air by means of liquid water The solute is subsequently recovered from the liquid by distillation and the absorbing liquid can be either discarded or reused Sometimes a solute is removed from a liquid by bringing the liquid into contact with an inert gas such an operation the reverse of gas absorption is desorption or gas stripping packing AND PACKED TOWER DESIGN A common apparatus used in gas absorption and certain other operations is the packed tower an example of which is shown in fig 18.1. The device consists of a cylindrical column or tower equipped with a gas inlet and distributing space at the bottom a liquid inlet and distributor at the top gas and liquid outlets at the top and bottom respectively and a supported mass of inert solid shapes called tower pack in The packing support is typically a screen corrugated to give it strength with @ large open area so that flooding does not occur at the support The inlet liquid which may be pure solvent or a dilute solution of solute in the solvent and which is called the weak liquor is distributed over the top of the packing by the distributor and in ideal operation uniformly wets the surfaces of the packing The distributor shown in fig 18.1 is a set of perforated pipes In large towers spray nozzles or distributor plates with overflow weirs are more common For very large towers up to 9 m (30 to in diameter Nutter Engineering advertises a plate distributor with individual drip tubes 565

For dilute mixtures containing less than 10 percent of soluble gas the effect of changes in the total flow is usually ignored the design is based on the average flow rates and the operating line is drawn as a straight line b be up b------------------- my ----- we 1 I 1 I 1 ! a | ' Y we \ e i I 1 x see I i i - SS so x - i of fly ! & Oo t \ Ne ' ' oo t I we t I not I ! a we ! | Yo to ' t i i ' it xu up xu x FIGURE 18.10 Limiting gas-liquid ration

578 section ivy Mass Transfer and Its Applications Limiting gas-liquid ratio Equation (18.6) shows that the average slope of the operating line is love the ratio of the molal flows of liquid and gas thus for a given gas flow a reduction in liquid flow decreases the slope of the operating line Consider the operating line a in fig 18.10. Assume that the gas rate and the terminal concentrations xu you and you are held constant and the liquid flow L decreased The upper end of the operating line then shifts in the direction of the equilibrium line and xu the concentration of the strong liquor increases The maximum possible liquor concentration and the minimum possible liquid rate are obtained when the operating line just touches the equilibrium line as shown by line abs in fig 18.10. At this condition an infinitely deep packed section is necessary as the concentration difference for mass transfer becomes zero at the bottom of the tower In any actual tower the liquid rate must be greater than this minimum to achieve the specified change in gas composition The lev ratio is important in the economics of absorption in a countercurrent column The driving force for mass transfer is y i you which is proportional to the vertical distance between the operating line and the equilibrium line on a diagram such as fig 18.10. Increasing lev increases the driving force everywhere in the column except at the very top and the absorption column does not need to be as tall however using a larger amount of liquid gives a more dilute liquid product which makes it more difficult to recover the solute by desorption or stripping The energy cost for stripping is often a major part of the total cost of an absorption-stripping operation The optimum liquid rate for absorption is found by balancing the operate in costs for both units against the fixed costs of the equipment In general the liquid rate for the absorber should be between 1.1 and 1.5 times the minimum rate unless the liquid is to be discarded and not regenerated The conditions at the top of the absorber are often design variables that also have to be set considering the balance between equipment and operating costs For example if tentative specifications call for 98 percent recovery of a product from a was stream the designer might calculate how much taller the column would have to be to get 99 percent recovery If the value of the extra product recovered exceeds the extra costs the optimum recovery is at least 99 percent and the calculation should be repeated for even higher recovery If the unremoved solute is a pollutants its concentration in the vent gas may be set by emission standards and the required percent recovery may exceed the optimum value based on product value and opera eating costs The diagram in fig 18.10 shows a significant concentration of solute in the liquid fed to the column and 99 percent removal from the gas would not be possie be for this case however a lower value of xu could be obtained by better stripping or more complete regeneration of the absorbing liquid The value of xu could be ops timized, considering the extra equipment and operating costs for more complete regeneration and the savings from better operation of the absorbers Rate of absorption The rate of absorption can be expressed in four different ways using individual coefficients or overall coefficients based on the gas or liquid phases Volumetric coefficients are used for most calculations because it is more difficult to determine

With xu and xu specified there is a minimum ratio of vapor to liquid core responding to the operating line that just touches the equilibrium line at some point The pinch may occur in the middle of the operating line if the equilibrium line is curved upwards as in fig 18.18, or it may occur at the top of the column at (,.Â¥,,)- For simplicity the operating line is shown as a straight line though it would genera ally be slightly curved because of the change in vapor and liquid rates In an overall process of absorption and stripping the cost of steam is often a major expense and the process is designed to use as little steam as possible The stripping column is operated at close to the minimum vapor rate and some solute is left in the stripped solution instead of trying for complete recovery When the equip lithium line is curved upwards as in fig 18.18. the minimum steam rate becomes much higher as xu approaches zero The height of a stripping column can be calculated from the number of transfer units and the height of a transfer unit using the same equations as for absorption Often attention is focused on the liquid-phase concentration and not and he are used do or = honor = how is (18.33) where my is given in end (18.29).

CHAPTER 18: Gas Absorption 607 Absorption in Plate Columns Gas absorption can be carried out in a column equipped with sieve trays or other types of plates normally used for distillation A column with trays is sometimes chop see instead of a packed column to avoid the problem of liquid distribution in a large diameter tower and to decrease the uncertainty in scaleup. Methods of determining the number of theoretical plates and estimating the average plate efficiency are dish cussed in chap 21. ABSORPTION WITH CHEMICAL REACTION Absorption followed by reaction in the liquid phase is often used to get more come plate removal of a solute from a gas mixture For example 2 dilute acid solution can be used to scrub the from gas streams and basic solutions are used to remove cop and other acid gases Reaction in the liquid phase reduces the equilibrium partial pressure of the solute over the solution which greatly increases the driving force for mass transfer If the reaction is essentially irreversible at absorption conditions the equilibrium partial pressure is zero and not can be calculated just from the change in gas composition For ya = i & my . Non i a = my 28 (18.48) a Ya To illustrate the effect of a chemical reaction consider the absorption of the in dilute hi with a 300-fold reduction in gas concentration i to 0.02 percent From end 118.48). not = In 300 = 5.7, which can be compared with not = 12 for the same change in concentration using water at the conditions of Example 18.4. A further advantage of absorption plus reaction is the increase in the mass transfer coefficient Some of this increase comes from a greater effective interfacial area since absorption can now take place in the nearly stagnant regions static holdup as well as in the dynamic liquid holdup For the absorption in hyson solutions Ka was 1.5 to 2 times the value for absorption in water Since the gas film resistance is controlling this effect must be due mainly to an increase in effect give area The values of ka for the absorption in acid solutions were about the same as those for vaporization of water where all the interfacial area is also expected to be effective The factors Kyct,.,/K type ANd K ,.,.,/K gay decrease with increasing liquid rate and approach unity when the total holdup is much larger than the static holdup The factor K 4,.4Â¢/K get also depends on the concentration of reactant and is smasher when only a slight excess of reagent is present in the solution fed to the column Data on liquid holdup and effective area have been published for ranching rings and bell saddles.~! but similar results for newer packing are not available When the liquid-film resistance is dominant as in the absorption of cop or is in aqueous solutions a rapid chemical reaction in the liquid can lead to a very large increase in the mass-transfer coefficient The coefficients shown in fig 18.23 for the CO,-H,O-NaOH system range from | to 4 mol/ft}-atm-h, compared to typical

but SECTION eve Mass Transfer and Its Applications values for cop in water of 0.05 to 0.2 mol/ftÂ®-atm-h. The rapid reaction consumes much of the cop very close to the gas-liquid interface which makes the gradient for cop steeper and enhances the process of mass transfer in the liquid The ratio of the apparent value of i to that for physical absorption defines an enhancement factor i which ranges from 1.0 to 1,000 or more Methods of predicting i from kinetic and mass-transfer data are given in other texts.?*?? When the value of dis very large the gas film may become the controlling resistance Although absorbing cop in nah solution gives high rates of mass transfer reagent costs and disposal problems make this approach impractical for large-scale used instead cop is removed by using aqueous solutions of amines or potassium carbonated where the chemical reaction is reversible Absorption in amine solutions can be carried out at 20 to 50Â°C and the spent solutions regenerated with steam a 100 to 130Â°C.'Â® Complete regeneration is not necessary since the equilibrium pressure of cop is very low until about 20 percent of the amine has reacted fig are 18.25 shows the equilibrium and operating lines for one case from a recent study of cop absorption in monoethanolamine solutions The Rate frat module of Aspen Plus was combined with thermodynamic and kinetic data to model the packed absorber and stripper and help determine the optimum operating condo tons Only 85 percent removal is shown in fig 18.25, but over 95 percent removal can be obtained at the same leg ratio with a taller column When absorption is accompanied by a very slow reaction the apparent values of ka may be lower than with absorption alone An example is the absorption of all in water followed by hydrolysis of the dissolved chlorine The slow hydrolysis reaction essentially controls the overall rate of absorption 4 _â_â_â 3 | fi... | Operating i & line & 2 7 - . | | 1 it Hae line o 0.1 0.2 03 0.4 0.5 mom CQ2/mol me FIGURE 18.25 cop absorption in monomethylamine mean solution after freesia and Rochelle.*)

CHAPTER 19 Humidification Operations Humidification and dehumidification involve the transfer of material between a pure liquid phase and a fixed gas that is nearly insoluble in the liquid These operations are somewhat simpler than those for absorption and stripping for when the liquid contains only one component there are no concentration gradients and no resistance to mass transfer in the liquid phase On the other hands both heat transfer and gas phase mass transfer are important and they influence each other In previous chapters they have been treated separately here and in drying of solids discussed in chap 24) they occur together and concentration and temperature change simultaneously DEFINITIONS In humidification operations especially as applied to the system air-water, a number of rather special definitions are in common used The usual basis for engineering calculations is a unit mass of vapor-free gas where vapor means the gaseous form of the component that is also present as liquid and gas is the component present only in gaseous form In this discussion a basis of a unit mass of vapor-free gas is used In the gas phase the vapor will be referred to as component A and the fixed gas as come potent be Because the properties of a gas vapor mixture vary with total pressure the pressure must be fixed Unless otherwise specified a total pressure of | at is as sued also it is assumed that mixtures of gas and vapor follow the ideal gas jaws Humidity 4 is the mass of vapor carried by a unit mass of vapor-free gas So defined humidity depends only on the partial pressure of the vapor in the mixture when the total pressure is fixed If the partial pressure of the vapor is pa at the molal ratio of vapor to gas at I at is p4/(P i p,).

A thermometer or other temperature-measuring device such as a thermocouple is covered by a wick which is saturated with pure liquid and immersed in a stream of gas having a definite temperature 7 and humidity 9â¬. Assume that initially the temperature of the liquid is about that of the gas Since the gas is not saturated liquid evaporates and because the process is adiabatic the latent heat is supplied at first by cooling the liquid As the temperature of the liquid decreases below that of the gas sensible heat is transferred to the liquid Ultimately a steady state ts reached at such a liquid temperature that the heat needed to evaporate the liquid and heat the vapor to gas temperature is exactly balanced by the sensible heat flowing from the gas to the liquid It is this steady-state temperature denoted by 7,,, that is

The counterblow tower can be used with a forced-draft fan at the base of the tower but a large space below the fill is needed for good air distribution In older towers the packing consisted of horizontal redwood or cypress slats spaced so that water falling on the slats would splash and the droplets be intercepted by the next layer of packing Splash-type fill is still used in some crossbow towers but shaped bars of polyvinyl chloride are used instead of wooden slats The press sure drop is low because airflow is parallel to the bars or slats and the open struck sure makes inspection and cleaning relatively easy Splash-type packing is not recommended for counterblow towers The most common type of packing for new installations is cellular fill or film type packing which consists of corrugated sheets of plastic similar to those used in plate-type heat exchangers Water flows over the surface of the packing giving more transfer area per unit volume than splash-type packing The plastic sheets are spaced : to 1.0 in (18 to 25 my apart to permit high flow rates of air and water with only moderate pressure drop The depth of fill may be only a few feet a small fraction of the total height of the unit With cellular fill it is especially important to get good distribution of the water at the top since redistribution does not occur naturally as it does with random dumped packing The reduction in water temperature in the cooling tower comes mainly from evaporation although when the air temperature is low there is also some sensible heat transfer to the air however even when the air is warmer than the water water can be cooled by evaporation if the wet-bulb temperature is below that of the water In practice the discharge temperature of the water is 5 to 15Â°F i to 8Â°C) above the wet-bulb temperature and this difference is known as the approach The change in water temperature from inlet to exit is known as the range and the range is genera ally 10 to 30Â°F i to 17Â°C).â The loss of water by evaporation during cooling is small Since about !.000 but is required to vaporize | i of water and 50 i must be cooled 20Â°F to provide 1.000 but a range of 20Â°F means an evaporation loss of 2 percent In addition there are losses of spray droplets referred to as drift or windage but in a well-designed tower these amount to only about 0.2 percent The total makeup water supplied must equal the evaporation and drift losses plus the amount of purge or lowdown needed to limit the buildup of dissolved salts Cooling towers are generally selected after consultation with equipment sup pliers and consideration of factors such as the average and maximum heat duty the required temperature range the availability and quality of makeup water and the local weather conditions The tower is often sized to satisfy all but the most extreme

The flow of heat to the interface just matches that needed for evaporation of the water that diffuses as vapor into the bulk gas There is no significant gradient in the liquid which remains at constant temperature By contrast in a cooling tower the water temperature changes as droplets pass through the tower and it is necessary to consider heat flow in the liquid phase as well as heat and mass transfer in the gas Typical gradients at the bottom and top of a cooling tower are sketched in fig 19.7. At the bottom the air temperature can be greater than the water tempera sure fig 19.7a), but the water is being cooled because the interface temperature i is tower than the bulk water temperature 7,. The humidity at the interface is greater than that in the bulk gas which provides a driving force for mass transfer of water vapor If the inlet air temperature is less than the exit water temperature as in fig 19.7b, the gradients are similar in shape but there is less sensible-heat trash fer through the gas film In all cases the interface temperature must be above the wet-bulb temperature since if to = i all the heat for vaporization would come from the gas and there would be no temperature gradient in the water and no cool in of the water As the air passes up through the tower the air temperature might decrease fora short distance but it will eventually increase as the air contacts warmer and warmer water At the top the gradients might be as shown in fig 19.7c.

Because of the curvature of the equilibrium line the minimum air rate is sometimes determined by a line tangent tote curve The air rate is generally chosen to be 1.2 to 2.0 times the minimum value The required packed height for a cooling tower can he determined by using the operating lineâequilibrium line diagram and an overall coefficient based on an end happy driving force To show why this is true the rate equations for the firewater system are examined The rate of sensible-heat answer from the water to the interface is guck to =hya(T, i T))dZ (19.28) where ha = volumetric heat-transfer coefficient for liquid The rate of heat transfer from the interface to the gas is you to = half i tyg do (19.29) where /1,a = volumetric heat-transfer coefficient for gas The rate of mass transfer of water vapor through the gas film is written first in the normal way using a molar flow rate and a mole fraction driving force A dilute gas is assumed so that i i you = 1.0. guy =k,a(y, i yid (19.30) Since for low-humidily air Gay = Gy/Mg, where my is the molecular weight of the inert gas (air), y is approximately proportional to # and #â¬/M, < 1/My, end (19.30) can be changed to i do = k,aMa(H; âH)dZ (19.31) The a terms in had had and ka are assumed to be identical Equation (19.31) is converted to an energy basis by multiplying by you go do = am go (FH; i had (19.32) Combining end (19.32) and end (19.29) gives my odd + Â¢,dT,) = [k,aMprg(H, i he i halt told (19.33) The Lewis relationship i = c,Mgk, is used to replace a in the bracketed term of end (19.33). i big do + i dT.) = kyaMglan(H; i i + (0, - tod (19.34) Since the term in parentheses on the left-hand side is the differential change in enthalpy and the bracketed term is an enthalpy difference end (19.34) becomes my d my = kyaM,(H, i my do (19.35) Thus the rate of change of gas enthalpy is proportional to the difference be tween the enthalpy at the interface and that in the bulk gas and the transfer coffin client is the normal gas-film transfer coefficient multiplied by my since go and H are based on mass not molest

P CHAPTER 20 Equilibrium-Stage Operations One class of mass-transfer devices consists of assemblies of individual units or stages interconnected so that the materials being processed pass through each stage in turn The two streams move countercurrent through the assembly in each stage they are brought into contact mixed and then separated Such multistage systems are called cascades For mass transfer to take place the streams entering each stage must not be in equilibrium with one another for it is the departure from equilibrium conditions that provides the driving force for transfer The leaving streams are us ally not in equilibrium either but are much closer to being so than the entering streams are The closeness of the approach to equilibrium depends on the effective ness of mixing and mass transfer between the phases To simplify the design of a cascade the streams leaving each stage are often assumed to be in equilibrium which by definition makes each stage ideal A correction factor or efficiency is applied later to account for any actual departures from equilibrium To illustrate the principle of an equilibrium-stage cascade two typical counter current multistage devices are described here one for distillation or gas absorption where the stages are arranged one above the other in a vertical column and one for solid-liquid contacting as in leaching where the stages are a series of stirred tanks on the same level Other types of mass-transfer equipment are discussed in later chapters EQUIPMENT FOR STAGE CONTACTS Typical distillation equipment Equipment for continuous distillation is shown in fig 20.1.

CHAPTER 20: Equilibrium-Stage Operations 645 lower-quality vapor coming up to the second stage At all stages in the column some low boilers diffuse from the liquid into the vapor and a corresponding amount of high boilers diffuse from the vapor into the liquid The heat of vaporization of the low boilers is supplied by the heat of condensation of the high boilers and the total molal flow of vapor up the column is nearly constant The upper section of the column above the feed plate is known as the recrifi- in section Here the vapor stream is enriched in low boilers as it is brought into contact with the reflux It is immaterial where the reflux originates provided its con generation in how boilers is sufficiently great to give the desired product The usual source of reflux is the condensate leaving condenser do Part of the condensate is withdrawn as the product and the remainder is returned to the top of the column Reflux is sometimes provided by partial condensation of the overhead vapor the reflux then differs in composition from the vapor leaving as overhead product Provided an azeotrope is not formed the vapor reaching the condenser can be brought as close to complete purity as desired by using a tall tower and a large reflux The section of the column below the feed plate is the stripping or enriching section in which the liquid is progressively stripped of low boilers and enriched in the high boiling components If the feed is liquid as is usually the case it adds to the liquid flow in the lower section of the column If in addition the feed is cold additional vapor must be provided by the reboiled to raise the temperature of the feed to the boiling point To accomplish this the additional vapor is condensed when it comes in contact with the feed adding still more to the liquid flowing down through the stripping section Details of column performance and the effects of feed condition are discussed in chap 21. From the reboiled liquid is withdrawn which contains most of the high boiling components and usually only a little of the low boilers This quid is called the bottom product or bottoms The column shown in fig 20.1a@ contains a number of plates or trays stacked one above the other Often these plates are perforated and are known as sieve plates details of which are shown in fig 20.15. They consist of horizontal trays carrying a number of holes and a vertical plate which acts as a downcomer and a segmental weird sometimes as discussed in chap 21, the holes contain valves or plugs which are lifted as vapor passes through them The downcomer from a given plate reaches nearly to the tray below Liquid flows over the weirs from plate to plate down the column passing across the plates where the rising vapor causes it to froth The vapor space above the froth contains a mist of fine droplets formed by the collapse in bubbles Most of the drops fall back into the liquid but some are entrained by the vapor and are carried to the plate above See chap 21 for a discussion of the effect of this entrainment on column performance Typical leaching equipment In leaching soluble material is dissolved from its mixture with an inert solid by means of a liquid solvent A diagrammatic flow sheet of a typical countercurrent leaching plant is shown in fig 20.2.

PRINCIPLES OF STAGE PROCESSES In the sieve-plate tower and the countercurrent leaching plant shown in figs 20.1 and 20.2, the cascade consists of a series of interconnected units or stages Study of the assembly as a whole is best made by focusing attention on the streams passing between the individual stages An individual unit in a cascade receives two streams one a V phase and one an L phase from the two units adjacent to it brings them into close contact and delivers L and V phases respectively to the same adjacent units The fact that the contact units may be arranged either one above the other as in the sieve-plate column or side by side as in a stage leaching plant is important mechanically and may affect some of the details of operation of individual stages The same material-balance equations however can be used for either arrangements Terminology for stage-contact plants The individual contact units in a cascade are numbered serially starting from one end In this book the stages are numbered in the direction of flow of the L phase

Using a plate column as an example fig 20.3 shows how the units in a cascade are numbered The total number of stages is not and the last stage in the plant is therefore the math stage To designate the streams and concentrations pertaining to any one stage all streams originating in that stage carry the number of the unit as a subscript thus for a two-component system y,,, is the mole fraction of component A in the V phase leaving stage n + i and la is the molal flow rate of the L phase leaving the nth stage The streams entering and leaving the cascade and those entering and leave in stage n in plate tower are shown in fig 20.3.

To under stand why this is true extend the dashed rectangle in fig 20.3 to include plate no and consider that the stream van coming to the bottom stage is equivalent to a stream from a hypothetical stage N + i so that ya corresponds to vy,; and xu to my limit early the stream la at the top of the column can be considered to come from a hypothetical stage numbered i so that the point (x9, Â¥,) or (x,, Â¥,) locates the true upper end of the operating line In a packed column or other nonstagewise contacting device such as the one described in chap 18 for gas absorption x and y are continuous functions of height z whereas in staged towers x and y have only discrete values The equilibrium line is of course continuous but the operating line is drawn to connect a series of come positions relating y,.,, to xu usually however we are not sure of the values of you and xu so we draw the operating line as a solid line When the flow rates are not constant in the column the operating line on a simple arithmetic plot is not straight The terminal compositions may still be used to locate the ends of the fine and material-balance calculations over sections of the column are made to establish a few intermediate points Often only one or two other points are needed because usually the operating line is only slightly curved The position of the operating line relative to the equilibrium line determines the direction of mass transfer and how many stages are required for a given separation The equilibrium data are found by experiment by thermodynamic calculations or from published sources and the equilibrium line is just a plot of the equilibrium values of xu and you For rectification in a distillation column the operating line must lie below the equilibrium line as shown in fig 20.4a. Then the vapor coming to any plate contains less of the low boiler than the vapor in equilibrium with the liquid leaving the plate so that vapor passing through the liquid will be enriched in the low-boiling component The relative slopes of the lines are not important as long as the lines do not touch the operating line could be less steep than the equilibrium line and progressive enrichment of the vapor would still take place The driving force for mass transfer is the difference ya i y,,4.aS shown in fig 20.4a. When one component is to be transferred from the V phase to the L phase as in the absorption of soluble material from an inert gas the operating line must lie above the equilibrium line as in fig 20.46. The driving force for mass transfer is now y,.,; i you or the difference between the actual vapor composition and the

The reverse of gas absorption is called desorption or stripping an operation carried out to recover valuable solute from the absorbing solution and regenerate the solution The operating line must then lie below the equilibrium line as in fig 20.4c. Usually the temperature or pressure is changed to make the equilibrium curve much steeper than for the absorption process Ideal contact stages The ideal stage is a standard to which an actual stage may be compared In an ideal stage the V phase leaving the stage is in equilibrium with the L phase leaving

The problem of determining the number of ideal stages needed to accomplish the gas-phase concentration change ya to ya and the liquid-phase concentration change xu to xu is solved as follows The concentration of the gas leaving the top stage which is stage i is you or Â¥). If the stage is ideal the liquid leaving is equilibrium with the vapor leaving so the point (x,. you must lie on the equilibrium curve This fact fixes point my found by moving horizontally from point a to the equilibrium curve The abscissa of point my is xu The operating line is now used It passes through all points having coordinates of the type (x,, Â¥,.41), and since xu is known y is found by moving vertically from point m to the operating line at point no the coordinates of which are (x,, y,).

The third stage is found by again repeating the con striction giving triangle pub For the situation shown in fig 20.5. the third stage is the last as the concentration of the gas entering that stage is you and the liquid leaving it is xu which are the desired terminal concentrations Three ideal stages are required for this separation The same construction can be used for determining the number of ideal stages needed in any cascade whether it is used for gas absorption stripping distillation teaching or liquid extraction The graphical step-by-step construction utilizing all alternately the operating and equilibrium lines to find the number of ideal stages was first applied to the design of distillation columns and is known as the McCabe- thieve method The construction can be started at either end of the column and in general the last step will not exactly meet the terminal concentrations as was the case in fig 20.5. A fractional step may be assigned or the number of ideal stages may be rounded up to the nearest whole number EXAMPLE 20.1, By means of a plate column acetone is absorbed from its mixture with air in a nonvolatile absorption oil The entering gas contains 30 mole percent acetone and the entering oil is acetone-free. Of the acetone in the air 97 percent is to be absorbed and the concentrated liquor at the bottom of the tower is to contain 10 mole percent acetone The equilibrium relationship is my = 1.9x,. Plot the operating line and determine the number of ideal stages solution Choose 100 mom of entering gas as a basis and set this equal to van The acetone entering is then 0.3 x 100 = 30 mole the air entering is 100 i 30 = 70 mole With 97 percent absorbed the acetone leaving is 0.03 x 30 = 0.9 mom and you = 0.9/70.9 = 0.0127; the acetone absorbed is 30 i 0.9 = 29.1 mole With 10 percent acetone in the leaving solution and no acetone in the entering oil 0.1L, = 29.1, and la = 291 mole Then la = 291 i 29.1 = 261.9 mole To find an intermediate point on the operating line make an acetone balance around the top part of the tower assuming a particular value of you the moles of acetone left in the gas For 10 mom left in the gas pa Leas i 7047007 The moles of acetone lost by the gas in this section 10 i 0.9, or 9.1, must equal the moles gained by the liquid Hence where y = 0.125, 9.1 i 3679 not 7 0.0336 Similar calculations for ya = 20 give y = 20/90 = 0.222 and x = 19.1/(261.9 + 19.1) = 0.068. The operating line is plotted in fig 20.6. Although it appears only slightly curved the slope at the top is 1.57 times the slope at the bottom The local slope is not equal to the local lev ration since when y is large the change in y is not proportional to the amount transferred because of the change in the total flow The lev ratio changes by a

Thus an equilibrium line that is almost linear near the origin but curves at higher concentrations is sometimes fitted by a straight line over part of its range to permit use of the premier equation The various forms of the premier equation were derived using concentrations in mole fractions which is the usual choice for distillation or absorption For some operations including extraction and leaching the concentrations may be expressed using mole ratios or mass ratios defined as the amount of diffusing component divided by the amount of inert nondiffusing components If this choice of units gives straight equilibrium and operating lines the premier equation can be used to find the number of stages In the design of a plant V is calculated from the proposed terminal concentrate tons and a selected value of A or so Equation (20.22) or (20.24) is used for absorb ton and end (20.28) for stripping In estimating the effect of a change in operating

CHAPTER 21 Distillation In practice distillation may be carried out by either of two principal methods The first method is based on the production of a vapor by boiling the liquid mixture to be separated and condensing the vapors without allowing any liquid to return to the still There is then no reflux The second method is based on the return of part of the condensate to the still under such conditions that this returning liquid is brought into intimate contact with the vapors on their way to the condenser Either of these methods may be conducted as a continuous process or as a batch process The first sections of this chapter deal with continuous steady-state distillation processes including single-stage partial vaporization without reflux flash distillation and continuous distillation with reflux rectification for systems containing only two components (Multicomponent distillation is discussed in chap 22.) Later sections are concerned with the design and performance of distillation equipment such as sieve tray columns and with batch distillation FLASH DISTILLATION Flash distillation consists of vaporizing a definite fraction of the liquid in such a way that the evolved vapor is in equilibrium with the residual liquid separating the vapor from the liquid and condensing the vapor Figure 21.1 shows the elements of a flash distillation plant Feed is pumped by pump a through heater do and the press sure is reduced through valve c An intimate mixture of vapor and liquid enters the vapor separator do in which sufficient time is allowed for the vapor and liquid portions to separate Because of the intimacy of contact of liquid and vapor before separation the separated streams are in equilibrium Vapor leaves through line e and liquid through line go 663

Assume that the plates are numbered serially from the top down and that the plate under consideration is the nth plate from the top Then the plate immediately above plate 1 is platen i i and that immediately below it is platen + 1.

Number of Ideal plates McCabe-Thiele Method The number of plates required for a particular distillation problem can be found by computer design programs such as aspen which usually use plate-to-plate calcium nations involving material and enthalpy balances In such programs the number of plates is specified first then for a given overhead composition and reflux ration the

CHAPTER 21: Distillation 673 composition of the bottoms is calculated If this is not satisfactory the reflux ratio or the number of plates is changed until the desired composition is found A simplified graphical procedure for calculating the number of plates is the McCabe-Thiele method This method can also be adapted for computer calculations When the operating lines represented by else (21.17) and (21.20) are plotted with the equilibrium curve on the my diagram the McCabe-Thiele step-by-step con striction can be used to compute the number of idea plates needed to accomplish a definite concentration difference in either the rectifying or the stripping section's Equations (21.17) and (21.20), however show that unless la and let are constant the operating lines are curved and can be plotted only if the change in these internal streams with concentration is known Enthalpy balances are required in the general case to determine the position of a curved operating line and a method of doing this is described later in this chapter Constant molal overflow For most distillations the molar flow rates of vapor and liquid are nearly con start in each section of the column and the operating lines are almost straight This results from nearly equal molar heats of vaporization so that each mole of high boiler that condenses as the vapor moves up the column provides energy to caponize about | mom of low boiler For example the molar heats of vaporization of toluene and benzene are 7,960 and 7,360 cal/mol, respectively so that 0.92 mom of toluene corresponds to [.0 mom of benzene The changes in enthalpy of the liquid and vapor streams and heat losses from the column often require slightly more vapor to be formed at the bottom so the molar ratio of vapor flow at the bottom of a column section to that at the top is even closer to 1.0. In designing columns or interpreting plant performance the concept of constant molal overflow is often used which means simply that in else (21.11) to (21.20), subscripts 2.â + 1lnr, and m + | on L and V may be dropped and L and V now refer to flows in the upper part of the column and L and V denote flows in the lower section In this simple find model the material-balance equations are linear and the operating lines straight An operating line can be plotted if the coordinates of two points on it are known Then the McCabe-Thiele method is used without requiring enthalpy ball access The method can be modified however to include enthalpy balances as in Example 21.5. Reflux ratio The analysis of fractionating columns is facilitated by the use of a quantity called the reflux ration Two such quantities are used One is the ratio of the reflux to for benzene-toluene and for many other pairs of similar hydrocarbons the heat of vaporization per unit mass is higher for the low boiler but the ratio is still close to 1.0. and operating lines based on mass fraction would be almost straight For systems such as ethanol-water. however the heats of vaporize ton are about the same per mom but quite different per unit mass so the use of molar quantities is advantageous for distillation calculations

The simplest arrangement for obtaining reflux and liquid product and one that is frequently used is the single total condenser shown in fig 21.76, which con senses all the vapor from the column and supplies both reflux and product When such a single total condenser is used the concentrations of the vapor from the top plate of the reflux to the top plate and of the overhead product are equal and can all be denoted by up The operating terminus of the operating line becomes point expo Xp), which is the intersection of the operating line with the diagonal Triangle arc in fig 2].8a then represents the top plate in the column When a partial condenser is used the liquid reflux does not have the same come position as the overhead product that is xu 4 up Sometimes two condensers are used in series first a partial condenser to provide reflux then a final condenser to provide liquid product Such an arrangement is shown in fig 21.7c. Vapor leaving the partial condenser has a composition you which is the same as up Under these conditions the diagram in fig 21.8b applies The operating line passes through the point (x). xu on the diagonal but as far as the column is concerned the operating line ends at point a which of course has the coordinates (x,, y,). Triangle aâbâcâ in fig 21,86 represents the top plate in the column Since the vapor leaving a partial condenser is normally in equilibrium with the liquid condensate the vapor compo position ya is the ordinate value of the equilibrium curve where the abscissa is xu as shown in fig 21.86. The partial condenser represented by the dotted triangle aba in fig 21.8b, is therefore equivalent to an additional theoretical stage in the distill nation apparatus : In the preceding treatment it is assumed that the condenser removes latent heat only and that the condensate is liquid at its bubble point Then the reflux L is equal to let the reflux from the condenser and V = van If the reflux is cooled below the

If the reboiled heat duty is unchanged and D is kept constant less liquid is returned to the column than before and the apparent reflux radio up is decreased The extra vapor that condenses to heat the reflux to its bubble point however increases the amount of liquid going down the column so that the slope of the operating line (L/V), is unchanged A serious disadvantage may occur when an air-cooled condenser is used for changes in air temperature may lead to fluctuate tons in the and the operation of the column may be difficult to control Bottom plate and reboiled The action at the bottom of the column is analogous to that at the top thus end (21.20), written for constant molal overflow becomes with L and later V used to denote flow rates in this section L big Â¥eÂ¢) = so it (21.26) lab lab If xu is set equal to xu in end (21.26), sing 18 also equal to xu i the operating line for the stripping section crosses the diagonal at point expo X,).

The construction can start either at the bottom of the stripping line or at the top of the rectifying line In the following it is assumed that the construction begins at the top and that a total condenser is used As the intersection of the operating lines is approached it must be decided when the steps should transfer from the rectifying line to the stripping fine The change should be made in such a manner that the maximum enrich went per plate is obtained so that the number of plates is as small as possible Figure 21.13 shows that this criterion is met if the transfer is made immediately after a value of x is reached that is less than the x coordinate of the intersection of the two operating lines The feed plate is always represented by the triangle that has one corner on the rectifying line and one corner on the stripping line At the optic mum position the triangle representing the feed plate straddles the intersection of the operating lines The transfer from one operating line to the other and hence the feed plate local tiny can be made at any location between points a and b in fig 21.13; but if the feed plate is placed anywhere but at the optimum point an unnecessarily large number of _~ââ. aah LI my late ya my | { we - lie | b , my | / xu | ss FIGURE 21.13 Optimum feed plate location ââ, with feed on plate 5 optimum location ------, with feed on plate 7.

Note that the liquid on the feed plate does not have the same composition as the feed except by coincidence even when the feed plate location is optimum When we are analyzing the performance of a real column the switch from one operating line to another must be made at areal feed plate Because of changes in feed composition and uncertainties in plate efficiency large columns are often operated with the feed entering a few plates above or below the optimum location If large changes in feed composition are anticipated alternate feed locations can be provided In an actual column with a fixed number of plates feeding on the wrong plate may seriously affect the column performance Feeding on too low a plate for example close to point b in fig 21.13, increases the number of plates in the recti lying section but many of them are now operating in a pinched region where the driving force is small These plates do very little separation The diagram therefore must change lowering the quality of both the top and bottom products to reflect the poorer performance of the plates Feeding too high in the column leads to similar consequences Heating and cooling requirements Heat loss from a large insulated column is relatively small and the column itself is essentially adiabatic The heat effects of the entire unit are confined to the condenser and the reboiled If the average molal latent heat is % and the total sensible heat change in the liquid streams is small the heat added in the reboiled go is van either in watts or but per hours When the feed is liquid at the bubble point q = the the heat supplied in the reboiled is approximately equal to that removed in the condenser but for other values of g this is not true see enthalpy balances on page 695.)

The second step is to draw the feed line Here f = i and the feed line is vertical and is continuation of line x = xu The third step is to plot the operating lines The intercept of the rectifying line on the y axis is from end (21.22), 0.974/(3.5 + i = 0.216. This point is connected with the point xu on the ya reference line From the intersection of the rectifying operating line and the feed line the stripping line is drawn The fourth step is to draw the rectangular steps between the two operating lines and the equilibrium curve In drawing the steps the transfer from the rectifying line to the stripping line is at the seventh step By counting steps it is found that besides the reboiled 11 ideal plates are needed and feed should be introduced on the seventh plate from the top (ii) The latent heat of vaporization of the feed A is 7,696/85.8 = 89.7 cal/g. sub situation in end (21.27) gives 0.44(95 i 20) gal OH = 1.237 ! 897 From end (21.34) the slope of the feed line is â1.37/(1 i 1.37) = 3.70. When steps are drawn for this case as shown in fig 21.15, it is found that a reboiled and 10 ideal plates are needed and that the feed should be introduced on the sixth plate (iii) From the definition of g it follows that for this case g = 4 and the slope of the feed line is â0.5. The solution is shown in fig 21.16. It calls for a reboiled and 12 plates with the feed entering on the seventh plate More plates are needed when the feed is largely vapor partly because the feed line slants to the left and a few more plates are required in the rectifying section The major reason however is that partially vaporized feed contributes less liquid to the stripping section than does a totally liquid feed and the reflux ratio in the stripping section is reduced to fulfill the conditions of the problem literally the just step which represents the reboiled should reach the concentration xu exactly This is nearly true in fig 21.14. usually xu does not correspond to an integral number of steps An arbitrary choice of the four quantities x,,, up up and re is not necessary fly consistent with an integral number of steps An integral number can be obtained by a slight adjust went of one of the four quantities but in view of the fact that a plate efficiency must be applied before the actual number of plates is established there is little reason for making this adjustment

The opera eating lines then both coincide with the diagonal This condition is called royal reflux At total reflux the number of plates is a minimum but the rates of feed and of both the overhead and bottom products are zero Total reflux represents one limiting case in the operation of fractionating columns The minimum number of plates required for a given separation may be found by constructing steps on an my diagram between compositions xu and xu using the 45Â° line as the operating line for both sections of the column Since there is no feed in a column operating under total reflux there is no discontinuity between the upper and lower sections For the special case of ideal mixtures a simple method is available for calcium eating the value of N,,,, from the terminal concentrations xu and up This is based on the relative volatility of the two components w,,, which is defined in terms of the equilibrium concentrations Yae/X okay = Leet (21.37) Yee/XBe A useful form of end (21.37) for finding ya from xu is be ye = (21.38) 1 + crap i axe An ideal mixture follows rabbit's law and the relative volatility is the ratio of the vapor pressures Thus Pa a Pix Ya = Pa axe YA P ! or a Pare we > P P x pimp Ps say = area PAP Es (21.39) waxy pop PS The ratio put pig does not change much over the range of temperatures encountered in a typical column so the relative volatility is taken as constant in the following derivation For a binary system y,/y, and x,/xy may be replaced by y4/(1 i you and x4/(1 ~ x4). 80 end (21.37) can be written for plate n + 1 as , sing at Oagpâ (21.40) to york to can Since at total reflux D = and lev = 1. yn4) = and See end (21.16). and note that the operating line is the 45Â° line this leads to xu xu a = go (21.41) ex 1 snap

CHAPTER 2]: Distillation 695 Since benzene-toluene solutions are ideal fig 21.21 was constructed using molar average heat capacities and heats of vaporization The reference temperature was taken as 80Â°C, the boiling point of benzene to simplify calculations The enthalpy values in fig 21.21 are for liquid mixtures at the bubble point and for vapor mixtures at the dew point both at 1.0 at Thus each point on the line is for a different temperature between 110.6 and 80Â°C, but the temperature for x = 0.5 is not the same as for y = 0.5, as shown by the difference between bubble and dew points in fig 21.2. The slight curvature in the enthalpyâconcentration graphs is due to the nonlinear change in bubble point and dew point with mole fraction benzene Consider an overall enthalpy balance for the system shown in fig 21.6.

In Example 21.5, the molar liquid rate decreased about 7 percent in going from the top plate to the feed plate mainly because of the higher molar heat of vaporize ton of toluene The terms for the change in sensible heat of the liquid and vapor streams nearly cancel since the liquid has a higher heat capacity but a lower flow rate than the vapor In the stripping section of the column there was almost no change in liquid rate although the vapor composition changed even more than in the rectifying section The liquid flow rate in the stripping section is always greater than the vapor rate and in Example 21.5, the product of flow rate and heat capacity for the liquid was 1.73 times that for the vapor Only part of the energy needed to heat the liquid from the feed plate temperature to the reboiled temperature could be supplied by cooling the vapor and the rest came from condensation of vapor in the column The difference between the heat of condensation of toluene and the heat of vaporization of benzene was nearly used up in providing the extra energy needed to heat the liquid so that there was only a slight increase in vapor flow from the reboiled to the feed plate Similar changes in L and V are likely to be observed for other ideal mixtures The more volatile component has a lower molal heat of vaporization since the heat of vaporization is roughly proportional to the normal boiling point (Troutonâs rule The change in V will be greatest in the upper section of the column where L is less than v and may be almost zero in the lower section where lev > 1.0. The per centare change in lev will be smaller than the change in L or v but the slight upward shift of the operating lines may be important when operating close to the minimum reflux ration as was the case in Example 21.5. For operation at twice the minimum reflux ratio or greater the effect of operating-line curvature would be very small for aqueous systems the molar heats of vaporization may be quite different leading to significant changes in L and v

For each section of the column the slope of the operating line is the ratio of liquid flow to vapor flow The upper operating line above where fa enters is not affected the middle line has a larger slope than the upper line because of the liquid added from for and the line for the lowest section where the amount of liquid is greatest has the largest slope The diagram is con strutted for the computer program prepared from the relative amounts of liquid and vapor in each section of the column Plates are stepped off in the usual way Similar procedures are used when a side stream is drawn off below the top of the column with a composition xu The draff reduces the amount of liquid passing lo the section below so the slope of the operating line in this region is less than that in the topmost section This is illustrated in fig 21.23b.

The increase in my with open area is Similar to the change in my for single orifices as the ratio of orifice diameter to pipe diameter increases The coefficients vary with plate thickness but for most sieve plates the thickness is only 0.1 to 0.3 times the hole size For these thicknesses and the typical fraction open area of 0.08 to 0.10, the value of c is 0.66 to 0.72. The amount of liquid on the plate increases with the weir height and with the flow rate of liquid but it decreases slightly with increasing vapor flow rate because this decreases the density of the froth The liquid holdup also depends on the pays kcal properties of liquid and vapor and only approximate methods of predicting the holdup are available A simple method of estimating i uses the weir height /i,,, the calculated height of clear liquid over the weir A,,, and an empirical correlation factor fa my = why + how (21.63)

(2).63) shows that i may be less than h,., which means less liquid on the tray than corresponds to the weir height This is a fairly common situation Downcomer level The level of liquid in the downcomer must be considerably greater than that on the plate because of the pressure drop across the plate Referring to fig 21.24, note that the top of the downcomer for plate # is at the same pressure as place 2 i i therefore the equivalent level in the downcomer must exceed that on the plate by an amount a plus any friction losses in the liquid A,,.

The upper limit of the vapor velocity in a sieve-tray column is usually deter mined by the velocity at which entrainment becomes excessive causing a large

CHAPTER 21: Distillation 709 Note that the effects of plate spacing and other variables in the correlation are similar to the effects predicted for other types of flooding Increasing the plate space in delays the onset of downcomer flooding and froth height flooding in addition to decreasing the chance for entrained drops to reach the next plate An increase in the vapor density decreases up in end (21.68): it also increases the drawplate pressure drop which can lead to downcomer flooding The surface tension terms which was not in the original correlation was added because of the lower flooding velocities observed with some organic squids A value of o = 20 dyn/cm is typical for or panic liquids and the correlation shows that the flooding velocity for such liquids is about 20 percent lower than for water for which o is about 72 dyn/cm. The corner nation may not be reliable for liquids with a very low surface tension in which cases the velocity might be limited by the froth height The effect of pressure is reflected in pya which is included in both the abscissa and ordinate of fig 21.26.

The murphies efficiency my is defined by my we (21.69) MoT nil where you = actual concentration of vapor leaving plate 1 Â¥,4; = actual concentration vapor entering plate 7 ya = concentration of vapor in equilibrium with liquid leaving downpipe from plate 7 The murphies efficiency is therefore the change in vapor composition from one plate to the next divided by the change that would have occurred if the vapor leaving were in equilibrium with the liquid leaving The liquid leaving is generally not the same as the average liquid on the plate and this distinction is important in comparing local and murphies efficiencies The murphies efficiency is defined using vapor concentrations as a matter of customs but the measured efficiencies are rarely based on analysis of the vapor phase because of the difficulty in getting reliable samples instead samples are taken of the liquid on the plates and the vapor compositions are determined from a McCabe-Thiele diagram A plate efficiency can be defined using liquid concentrate tons but this is used only occasionally for desorption or stripping calculations Columns operated at high velocity will have significant entrainment and this reduces the plate efficiency because the drops of entrained liquid are less rich in the more volatile component than is the vapor Although methods of allowing for

Since the concentration of the liquid on the plate is everywhere the same so is that of the vapor from the plate and no gradients exist in the vapor streams A comparison of the quantities in else (21.69) and (21.70) shows that to = Nae meet = you and ya = you Then nay =nâ. and the local and murphies efficiencies are equal In larger columns liquid mixing in the direction of flow is not complete and a concentration gradient does exist in the liquid on the plate The maximum possible variation is from a concentration of x,_, at the liquid inlet to a concentration of xu at the liquid outlet To show the effect of such a concentration gradient consider a portion of the McCabe-Thiele diagram as shown in fig 21.28.

The relation between 1,4, and i depends on the degree of liquid mixing and whether or not the vapor is mixed before going to the next plate Calculations have shown only a small difference in efficiency for completely mixed vapor or unmixed vapor but the effect of no liquid mixing can be quite large Most studies have assumed complete vapor mixing in order to simplify the calculations for various degrees of liquid mixing A correlation based on plug flow of liquid across the plate with eddy diffusion in the liquid phase was developed by workers at the University of Delawareâ and is given in fig 21.29.

Relation between murphies and overall efficiencies The overall efficiency of a column is not the same as the average murphies efficiency of the individual plates The relation between these efficiencies depends on the relative slopes of the equilibrium line and the operating line When the equilibrium line is steeper than the operating line which is typical for stripping columns the overall efficiency is greater than the murphies efficiency if 4 is less than 1.0. Consider a portion of the column where the liquid composition changes from xu to x)y, a change requiring 1.0 ideal stage as shown in fig 21.32a. If two plates are actually required for this change the overall efficiency for that portion of the column ts 50 percent however if two partial steps are drawn assuming 7 = 0.50, as shown by the dashed line then the predicted value of my is too high since the first step would go halfway from Xt), lO xu and the second step would be a much larger change The correct value of no iS about 0.40, as shown in the steps drawn with a solid line When the equilibrium line is less steep than the operating line as usually occurs near the top of the rectifying section the overall efficiency is less than the murphies efficiency as illustrated in fig 21.32b. For this case two ideal plates are needed to go from xu to xu and if four actual plates are required the overall efficiency is 0.50.

The net effect is a nearly constant hut or help over a i to 2.5-fold range of flows The help decreases in the loading region because of the more rapid increase in liquid holdup and wetted area but help then increases sharply as flooding is approached With these high-capacity packing the rise in help is believed due to entrainment of the liquid The recommended design velocity for these packing is 20 percent less than the velocity at which help starts to rise rapidly Structured sheet-metal packing give slightly better separation than dumped packing and the help values are nearly constant over a three to fourfold range of flow rates Even more efficient are the gauzc-type packing with help values that increase from about 3 to 6 in (0.! to 0.2 my over a fourfold range of velocity ties The gauze is completely wetted even at low flow rates and the help can be predicted from fundamental equations for mass transfer in wetted channels There is no corresponding theory for other structured packing or for dumped packing because it is difficult to predict the wetted area Low surface tension tends to in crease the wetted area but too low values may lead to foaming which increases help BATCH DISTILLATION In some small plants volatile products are recovered from liquid solution by batch distillation The mixture is charged to a still or reboiled and heat is supplied through a coil or through the wail of the vessel to bring the liquid to the boiling point and then vaporize part of the batch In the simplest method of operation the vapors are taken directly from the still to a condenser as shown in fig 21.35. The vapor leaving the still at any time is in equilibrium with the liquid in the still but since the vapor is richer in the more volatile component the compositions of liquid and vapor are not constant To show how the compositions change with time consider what happens if moles are charged to a batch still Let n be the moles of liquid left in the still at a given time and y and x be the vapor and liquid compositions The total moles of component A left in the still i will be no = in (21.83) Condenser Batch still Cooling water Steam Product receiver FIGURE 21.35 Simple distillation in a batch sully

If a simple batch distillation at atmospheric pressure is used to red move 90 percent of the butane how much pentane will be removed What will be the composition of the remaining liquid solution The final liquid is nearly pure pentane and its boiling point is 36Â°C. The vapor pressure of butane at this temperature is 3.4 at giving a relative volatility of 3.4. For the initial conditions the boiling point is about 27Â°C, and the relative volatility is 3.6. therefore an average value of 3.5 is used for ago basis | mom feed not = 0.15 butane no = 0.015 Nog = 0.85 pentane From end (21.90) was = O.1NPS = 0518 my = 0.518(0.85) = 0.440 0.444 0.01 0.455 mom 0.015 = 0.033 n = 0.444 0.015 = 0.455 mom 44 = 9455 79 Batch distillation with reflux Batch distillation with only a simple still does not give a good separation unless the relative volatility is very high In many cases a rectifying column with reflux is used to improve the performance of the batch still If the column is not too large it may be mounted on top of the reboiled as shown in fig 20.1, or it may be supported independently with connecting pipes for the vapor and liquid streams The operation of a batch still and column can be analyzed using a McCabe-Thiele diagram with the same operating-line equation that was used for the rectifying sect ton of continuous distillation [Eq. (21.22)]: You = for the en my few my i The system may be operated to keep the top composition constant by in creasing the reflux ratio as the composition of the liquid in the reboiled changes The MeCabe-Thiele diagram for this case would have operating lines of different slope positioned such that the same number of ideal stages was used to go from xu to xu at any time A typical diagram is shown in fig 21.36 for a still with five ideal stages including the reboiled The upper operating line is for the initial conditions when the concentration of low boiler in the still is about the same as the charge composition the concentration xu is slightly lower than xu because of the holdup of liquid on the plates The lower operating line and the dashed line steps show conditions when about one-third of the charge has been removed as overhead product To determine the reflux ratio needed for a constant up and given xu requires a trial-and-error calculations since the last step on the assumed operating line must end exactly at xu however once the initial reflux ratio is chosen by this method the value of xu for a later stage in the distillation can be obtained by assuming a value

CHAPTER 22 Introduction to Multicomponent Distillation In multicomponent distillation as in the distillation of binary mixtures the calculate ton of equilibrium stages uses mass and enthalpy balances and vapor-liquid equip liberia A mass balance can be written for each component for the column as a whole or for a single stage but there is only one enthalpy balance for the column or for each stage The phase equilibria are much more complex than for binary systems because of the several components and because the equilibria depend on tempera sure which changes from stage to stage In binary systems the temperature and equilibria also change from stage to stage but except with azeotrope the more volatile component is more volatile than the other component throughout the call um In multicomponent mixtures one component may be more volatile than the average in one part of the column and less volatile than the average in another part which leads to complex concentration profiles In practice the field is dominated by the use of digital computers because of the mass of numbers needed to quantify the operating and engineering variables and the many iterations required to obtain convergence of the solutions to the equations This chapter does not include computer programs but all such programs are based squarely on the principles to which this text is devoted PHASE EQUILIBRIA IN MULTICOMPONENT DISTILLATION The vapor-liquid equilibria for a mixture are described by distribution coefficients or K factors where K for each component is the ratio of mole fractions in the vapor and liquid phases at equilibrium ka = 22.1) die 737

FRACTIONATION OF MULTICOMPONENT MIXTURES As in the fractionation of binary mixtures ideal plates are assumed in the design of cascades and the number of stages is subsequently corrected for plate efficient lies The two limiting conditions of total reflux minimum number of plates and minimum reflux are also determined to help validate the design Calculations for distillation plants are made by either of two methods In the first a desired separation of components is assumed and the numbers of plates above and below the feed are calculated for a chosen reflux ration In the second the number of plates above and below the feed is assumed and the separation of components is calculated using assumed flows of reflux from the condenser and vapor from the reboiled In binary distillation the first method is the more common in multicomponent cases the second approach is preferred especially in computer calculations In final computer calculations neither constant molal overflow nor temperature independent K factors are assumed and plate efficiencies are also introduced but in preliminary estimates the simplifying assumptions are common When the activity coefficients are assumed to be temperature-independent, group methods are used in which the number of ideal stages in a cascade is the dependent variable The calculation gives this number without solving for either the plate temperature or the compositions of the interstreams between plates If a values are temperature dependent these simple methods are not used and plate-by-plate calculations are necessary The temperature and liquid composition for plate n i | are calculated by trial from those already known for plate no and the calculation proceeds from plate to plate up or down the column

CHAPTER 22: Introduction to Multicomponent Distillation 743 In the rest of this chapter these methods are sampled in the following way The estimates of the minimum number of plates at infinite reflux and of minimum reflux with an infinite number of plates are made by group methods on the assumption of constant relative volatility's and are based on a design point of view Two empirical relations for the number of plates at an operating reflux are described Key components The objective of distillation is the separation of the feed into streams of nearly pure products In binary distillation the purity is usually defined by specifying xu and xu the mole fraction of light component in the distillate and bottoms products As shown by end (21.8), fixing these concentrations fixes the amounts of both prod acts per unit of feed The reflux ratio is then chosen and the number of theoretical stages is calculated In multicomponent distillation there are three or more components in the prod acts and specifying the concentrations of one component in each does not fully characterize these products however if the concentrations of two out of three or three out of four components are specified for the distillate and bottoms products it is generally impossible to meet these specifications exactly An increase in reflux ratio or number of plates would increase the sharpness of the separation and the desired concentration of one component in each product could be achieved but it would be a coincidence if the other concentrations exactly matched those specified beforehand The designer generally chooses two components whose concentrations or fractional recoveries in the distillate and bottoms products are a good index of the separation achieved After these components are identified they are called key come ponents. Since the keys must differ in volatility the more volatile identified by sub script la is called the light key and the less volatile identified by subscript he is called the heavy key Having chosen the keys the designer arbitrarily assigns small numbers to xu in the distillate expo and to xu in the bottoms (xg,). just as small numbers are assigned to up and go in binary distillation Choosing small values for go and pay Means that most of the light key ends up in the distillate and most of the heavy key in the bottoms The distillate may be nearly pure light key if the keys are the two most volatile components since components heavier than the heavy key will tend to concentrate in the liquid phase and not be carried much above the feed plate Often there are components lighter than the light key and these are nearly completely recovered in the distillate Any components heavier than the heavy key are usually completely recovered in the bottoms The exceptions to these generalizations are encountered in distillation of very close boiling materials such as mixtures of isomers Unlike the binary case the choice of two keys does not give determinate mass balances because not all other mole fractions are calculable by mass balances alone and equilibrium calculations are required to calculate the concentrations of the dew point vapor from the top plate and the bubble-point liquid leaving the reboiled Although any two components can be nominated as keys usually they are adjacent in the rank order of volatility Such a choice is called a sharp separation In sharp separations the keys are the only components that appear in both products in appreciable concentrations

Light components are undistributed at minimum reflux if the value of K is high enough for plates below the feed plate If xu is assumed zero end (21.19) leads to L vent = am (22.18) v thus most ET (22.19) in ka If K is always greater than rev in the bottom section of the column y will become zero justifying the assumption that xu = 0.

Concentration profiles calculated for a depropanizer operating at 300 Ib/in? absolute are shown in fig 22.3. There are 40 stages counting the reboiled and con denser with feed entering as liquid on stage 20. The reflux ratio is 2.62, which is 1.25Rpm. The concentration profiles are characteristic of systems with components both lighter and heavier than the keys The maxima shown for the light key and the heavy key and the shape of the other profiles can be better understood by examine in the operating lines and the equilibrium relationships for individual components on ya diagram In the upper section of the column lev is nearly constant and the operating line for ethane is last = 0.724x, + 0.061 The equilibrium relationship y = ex is shown in fig 22.4a as a family of straight lines with the slope increasing as 1 increases Each of the straight lines is used only once for the appropriate plate number Starting from up = 0.222, only a few plates are needed to reduce x to about 0.05, which results in a âpinch.â The pinch shifts to lower values of x as the temperature increases and K increases but the change from plate to plate is very small as shown in fig 22.3.

756 SECTION eve Mass Transfer and Its Applications above the equilibrium curve so x decreases going up the column From the feed plate to plate 15 the temperature is high enough to make K > 0.7, and the equilib- rum line shifts to give values above the operating line Therefore butane increases in concentration on going up from the feed plate The change in plate temperature in this region is strongly influenced by the decrease in the heavy monkey components butane and n-pentane. Without these or similar components the heavy key would not show any maximum concentration With a relatively large amount of heavy none key components the heavy key not only shows a maximum but may increase more rapidly than the light key and exhibit reverse fractionation for a few stages The first few plates above the reboiled show sharp changes in the concentrations of pentane and n-butane, similar to that shown by ethane near the top of the column and this results in a maximum concentration of butane at plate 34. The concentrate lion of pentane is nearly constant from plate 35 to the feed plate because of a pinch and changes slowly as the temperature gradually decreases The butane does not show such a plateau because its volatility is about 0.8 that of i-butane, the heavy key Rate-based models for multicomponent distillation Multicomponent distillation columns are often designed by calculating the number of ideal stages and dividing by an estimated overall efficiency 4,, or by using a constant murphies efficiency i at each stage of the computations how ever my values may be quite different for each component and the values change with temperature and composition An alternative approach features rate-based models that use thermodynamic data and the rigorous Maxwell-Stephan equations for multicomponent diffusion to get local mass-transfer rates for each component These rates are used in conjunction with empirical correlations for mass transfer and tray hydraulics to find the concentration changes on each plate There is no need ta determine tray efficiencies but i values may be calculated for each come potent to illustrate the differences between rate-based models and equilibrium stage models These differences can be significant In the vapor phase the flux of any one component depends on the fluxes of the other components as well as on the mole-fraction driving force A minor component may have a negative local efficiency at some point because of molecules carried against the concentration gradient or the efficiency may be very high greater than 100 percent because of the fluxes of the other components Unusual values of 1744 may also be found for major components near plates where the concentrations go through local maxima or minimal as shown for the light and heavy keys in the depropanizer example of fig 22.3. When the components of a mixture differ significantly in molecular size or pop clarity the vapor-phase diffusional interactions can have a large effect on column performance Rate-based calculations for the methanol-isopropanol-water system showed an overall column efficiency 39 percent less than the average for the binary pairs A similar analysis of the water-ethanol-acetone separation showed that 50 percent more stages were needed to meet product specifications than when using an equilibrium model with an average efficiency of 60 percent For separation of a nearly ideal liquid mixture as in a debutanizer. the rate-based model showed sudden changes in efficiency at a few stages but the composition

CHAPTER 22: Introduction to Multicomponent Distillation 737 profiles for key components were not much different from those calculated using the simpler equilibrium-stage model The rate-based model however is recomb mended if accurate profiles for the minor components are needed In the debutanizer example the efficiencies were generally relatively low for propane (45 to 60 per cents but increased with molecular weight for the heavier components which is opposite to the change in binary diffusion coefficients This tend shows the import dance of the liquid-phase resistance which becomes greater for Jow-molecular- weight components because of high values of ka the equilibrium constant K is equivalent to my in end (17.61).] The gas film has the controlling resistance for the key components as it does for most binary systems but the liquid film may be con trolling for the lightest components Number of ideal plates at operating reflux Although the precise calculation of the number of plates in multicomponent distillation is best accomplished by computer a simple empirical method due to Gilliland' is much used for preliminary estimates The correlation requires know edge only of the minimum number of plates at total reflux and the minimum reflux ration The correlation is given in fig 22.5 and is self-explanatory. The Gilliland correlation however is based mainly on calculations for systems with nearly constant relative volatility and may be considerably in error for unideal systems An alternate correlation in fig 22.6 shows that the ratio of nim for ideal binary systems depends mainly on Ryp/Rp,, for a wide range of relative volatilities. On the other hands for the system methanol-water, where @ changes from 7.5 for dilute solutions to 2.7 for nearly pure methanol the values of nankin are much greater and change more rapidly than with ideal systems The McCabe-Thiele diagram in fig 22.7 shows why this is so The upper part of the equilibrium line is virtually linear and parallel to the operating line and 10 a her FIGURE is of 96 i we Gilliland correlation be we SET the t it my if a he i FA i 2 i find ja oo she she see aka 00% a = one AT 00 IN we 0.61 0.02 0.04 010 02 0406 10 to = from roe

The azeotrope will of course contain some of all come parents in the feed but it will have a much different ratio of the keys than the feed An example of allotropic distillation is the use of benzene heptane or cycle hexane to permit the separation of ethanol and water which form a minimum boiling azeotrope with 95.6 weight percent alcohol The alcohol-water mixture with about 95 percent alcohol is fed near the middle of the dehydrating column and nearly pure alcohol is removed as the bottoms product The overhead vapor is a ternary azeotrope which is condensed and separated into two phases The upper or panic layer is returned to the top of the dehydrating column as reflux and the water layer is sent to a stripping column where alcohol and the hydrocarbon entrained are taken overhead and returned to the first column The stripper bottom is an aqueous stream that is discharged as wastepaper or sent to a third column to recover some of the alcohol SYMBOLS B Flow rate of heavy or bottom product mouth can Molar heat capacity call mom -âC; my average value D Flow rate of light or overhead product mouth F Feed rate mouth f Fraction of feed that is vaporized for of component 7 H Enthalpy of stream call mom or Btu/Ib mom K Equilibrium ration y,/x,: kid kid of components i and ja K,,,, of reference component go for an infinite number of plates K . stripping section

yo CHAPTER 23 Leaching and Extraction This chapter discusses the methods of removing one constituent from a solid or liquid by means of a liquid solvent These techniques fall into two categories The first called leaching or solid extraction is used to dissolve soluble matter from its mixture with an insoluble solid The second called liquid extraction is used to recover a valuable product from a multicomponent solution by contact with an immiscible solvent that has a high affinity for the product Liquid extraction can also be used lo separate close-boiling liquids that would be difficult to separate by distillation LEACHING Leaching differs very little from the washing of filtered solids as discussed in chap 29. and leaching equipment strongly resembles the washing section of various filters In leaching the amount of soluble material removed is often greater than in ordinary filtration washing and the properties of the solids may change considerably during the leaching operation coarse hard or granular feed solids may disintegrate into pulp or mush when their content of soluble material is removed Leaching Equipment When the solids form an open permeable mass throughout the teaching operation solvent may be percolated through an agitated bed of solids With imperme- able solids or materials that disintegrate during leaching the solids are dispersed into the solvent and are later separated from it Both methods may be either batch or continuous 764

CHAPTER 23: Leaching and Extraction 765 Leaching by percolation through stationary solid beds Stationary solid-bed leaching is done in a tank with a perforated false bottom to support the solids and permit drainage of the solvent Solids are loaded into the tank sprayed with solvent until their solute content is reduced to the economical minimum and excavated In some cases the rate of solution is so rapid that one passage of solvent through the material is sufficient but countercurrent flow of solvent through a battery of tanks is more common In this method fresh solvent is fed to the tank containing the solid that is most nearly extracted it flows through the several tanks in series and is finally withdrawn from the tank that has been freshly charged Such a series of tanks is called an extraction battery The solid in any one tank is stationary until it is completely extracted The piping is arranged so that fresh solvent can be introduced to any tank and strong solution withdrawn from any tank making it possible to charge and discharge one tank at a time The other tanks in the battery are kept in countercurrent operation by advancing the inlet and draff tanks one at a time as the material is charged and removed Such a process is sometimes called a Shanks process In some solid-bed leaching the solvent is volatile necessitating the use of closed vessels operated under pressure Pressure is also needed to force solvent through beds of some less permeable solids A series of such pressure tanks opera ate with countercurrent solvent flow is known as a diffusion battery Moving-bed leaching In the machines illustrated in fig 23.1 the solids are moved through the solvent with lite or no agitation The bellman extractor fig 23.la) contains a bucket elevator in a closed casing There are perforations in the bottom of each bucket At the top nght-hand corner of the machine as shown in the drawing the buckets are loaded with flaky solids such as soybeans and are sprayed with appropriate amounts of half micelle as they travel downward Half micelle is the intermediate solvent containing some extracted oil and some small solid particles As solids and solvent flow concurrently down the right-hand side of the machine the solvent extracts more oil from the beans Simultaneously the fine solids are filtered out of the solvent so that clean full micelle can be pumped from the right-hand sump at the bottom of the casing As the partially extracted beans rise through the left side of the machine a stream of pure solvent percolates countercurrent through them It collects in the left-hand sump and is pumped to the half-miscella storage tank Fully extracted beans are dumped from the buckets at the top of the elevator into a hopper from which they are removed by paddle conveyors The capacity of typical units is 50 to 500 tons of beans per 24-h day In the Rotoce! extractor illustrated in fig 23.15, a horizontal basket is divided into walled compartments with a floor that is permeable to the liquid The basket rotates slowly about a vertical axis Solids are admitted to each compartment at the feed point the compartments then successively pass a number of solvent sprays a drainage section and a discharge point at which the floor of the compartment opens to discharge the extracted solids The empty compartment moves to the feed point to receive its next load of solids To give countercurrent extraction

The L phase is the liquid carried with the solid as it moves from stage | to stage no Exhausted solids leave stage no and concentrated solution overflows from stage 1. It is assumed that the solute-free solid is insoluble in the solvent and that the flow rate of this solid is constant throughout the cascade The solid is porous and inert no adsorption and carries with it an amount of solution that may or may not be constant Let L refer to the flow of this retained liquid and V to the flow of the overflow solution The flows and L may be expressed in mass per unit time or may be based on a definite flow of dry solute-free solid also in accordance with stand hard nomenclature the terminal concentrations are as follows Solution retained by entering solid xu Solution retained by leaving solid xu Fresh solvent entering the system i Concentrated solution leaving the system v As in absorption and distillation the quantitative performance of a countercurrent system can be analyzed by utilizing an equilibrium fine and an operating line and as before the method to be used depends on whether these lines are straight or curved Equilibrium In leaching provided sufficient solvent is present to dissolve all the solute in the entering solid and there is no adsorption of solute by the solid equilibrium is attained when the solute is completely dissolved and the concentration of the solution so formed is uniform Such a condition may be obtained simply or with difficulty depending on the structure of the solid These factors are considered when stage efficiency is discussed At present it is assumed that the requirements for equilibrium are met Then the concentration of the liquid retained by the solid leaving any stage is the same as that of the liquid overflow from the same stage The equilibrium relationship is simply xu = ya Operating line The equation for the operating line is obtained by writing material balances for that portion of the cascade consisting of the first 7 units as shown by the control surface indicated by the dashed lines in fig 23.2.

Four ideal stages are required Saturated concentrated solution A special case of leaching is encountered when the solute is of limited solubility and the concentrated solution reaches saturation This situation can be treated by the above methods The solvent input to stage no should be the maximum that is consist tent with a saturated overflow from stage i and all liquids except that adhering to the underflow from stage | should be unsaturated If too little solvent is used and sat ration is attained in stages other than the first all but one of the saturated stages are ineffective and the solute concentration in the underflow from stage N is higher than it would be if more fresh solvent were used Stage efficiencies In most leaching operations the solute is distributed through a more or less permeable solid The rate of leaching is largely governed by the rate of diffusion through the solid as discussed in chap 17, and the actual number of stages required

The aromatics have poor viscosity-temperature characteristics but they cannot be removed by distillation because of the overlap ping boiling-point ranges In a similar process aromatics are extracted from catalytic reformat using a high-boiling-point polar solvent and the extract is later distilled to give pure benzene toluene and xylenes for use as chemical intermedi- test An excellent solvent for this use is the cyclic compound C,H,SO, (Sulfolane), which has high selectivity for aromatics and very low volatility be of 290Â°C). When either distillation or extraction may be used the choice is usually distill nation in spite of the fact that heating and cooling are needed In extraction the solvent must be recovered for reuse usually by distillation and the combined operation is more complicated and often more expensive than ordinary distillation without extraction however extraction does offer greater flexibility in choice of operating conditions since the type and amount of solvent can be varied as well as the operating temperature In this sense extraction is more like gas absorption than ordinary distillation In many problems the choice between methods should be based on a comparative study of both extraction and distillation Extraction may be used to separate more than two components and mixtures of solvents instead of a single solvent are needed in some applications These more complicated methods are not treated in this text Extraction equipment In liquid-liquid extraction as in gas absorption and distillation two phases must be brought into good contact to permit transfer of material and then separated In absorption and distillation the mixing and separation are easy and rapid In extract tiny however the two phases have comparable densities so that the energy avail able for mixing and separation---if gravity flow is usedâis small much smaller than when one phase is a liquid and the other is a gas The two phases are often hard to mix and harder to separate The viscidities of both phases also are relax lively high and linear velocities through most extraction equipment are low In some types of extractors therefore energy for mixing and separation is supplied mechanically Extraction equipment may be operated batchwise or continuously A quantity of feed liquid may be mixed with a quantity of solvent in an agitated vessel after which the layers are settled and separated The extract is the layer of solvent plus extracted solute and the raffinate is the layer from which solute has been removed

Liquid-liquid extraction can also be carried out using porous membranes as described in chap 26. This method has promise for difficult separations Mixer-settlers For batchwise extraction the mixer and settler may be the same unit A tank containing a turbine or propeller agitator is most common At the end of the mixing cycle the agitator is shut off the layers are allowed to separate by gravity and extract and raffinate are drawn off to separate receivers through a bottom drain line carrying a sight glass The mixing and settling times required for a given extraction can be determined only by experiment 5 in for mixing and LO in for settling are typical but both shorter and much longer times are common For continuous flow the mixer and settler are usually separate pieces of equip went The mixer may be a small agitated tank provided with inlets and a draff line and baffles to prevent short-circuiting, or it may be a motionless mixer or other flow mixer The settler is often a simple continuous gravity decanter With liquids that emulsify easily and have nearly the same density it may be necessary to pass the mixer discharge through a screen or pad of glass fiber to coalesce the droplets of the dispersed phase before gravity settling is feasible For even more difficult separations tubular or disk-type centrifuges are employed

The raffinate from each settler becomes the feed to the next mixer where it meets intermediate extract or fresh solvent The principle is identical with that of the continuous countercurrent stage leaching system shown in fig 20.2. Packed extraction towers Tower extractors give differential contacts not stage contacts and mixing and settling proceed continuously and simultaneously Extraction can be carried out in an open tower with drops of heavy liquid falling through the rising light liquid or vice versus however such towers called spray towers are rarely used because of pronounced axial mixing in the continuous phase instead the tower is filled with packing such as rings or saddles see fig 18.2), which causes the drops to coalesce and reform and tends to limit axial dispersion In an extraction tower there is continuous transfer of material between phases and the composition of each phase changes as it flows through the tower At any given level of course equilibrium is not reached indeed it is the departure from equilibrium that provides the driving force for mass transfer The design procedure for extraction towers is similar to that for packed absorption towers but the height of a transfer unit is generally greater than for a typical absorbers Flooding velocities in packed towers If the flow rate of either the dispersed phase or the continuous phase is held constant and that of the other phase gradually increased a point is reached where the dispersed phase coalesces the holdup of that phase increases and finally both phases leave together through the continuous-phase outlet The effect like the corresponding action in an absorption column is called flooding The larger the flow rate of one phase at flooding the smaller is that of the other A column obviously should be operated at flow rates below the flooding point Flooding velocities in packed columns can be estimated from an empirical equation.ââ

CHAPTER 23; Leaching and Extraction 781 Extraction of concentrated solutions phase equilibria In the extraction of concentrated solutions the equilibrium relationships are more complicated than in other kinds of separation because there are three or more components present and some of each component is present in each phase The equilibrium data are often presented on a triangular diagram such as those shown in figs 23.7 and 23.8. The system acctoneâwaterâmethy! isobutyl ketone (MIK), fig 23.7, is an example of a type I system which shows partial miscibility of the solvent mike and the diluent water but complete miscibility of the solvent and the component to be extracted (acetone). Anilineâ-n-heptane~methylcyclohexane (MCH) forms a type i system fig 23.8), where the solvent aniline is only partially miscible with both the other components Some of the features of an extraction process can be illustrated by using fig 23.7. When solvent is added to a mixture of acetone and water the composition of the resulting mixture lies on a straight line between the point for pure solvent and the point for the original binary mixture When enough solvent is added so that the overall composition falls under the dome-shaped curve the mixture separates into two phases The points representing the phase compositions can be joined by a straight tie line which passes through the overall mixture composition For clarity only a few such tie lines are shown and others can be obtained by interpolation The Acetone you 1.00 Or oh Xy0.1 of SOLA 2 exon ON oh lam 0.3 o we riled so DESECOLEDB 04 % & reran AY of 05 hE ley not is i J > foe a we e a ferns Lee % 03 feel SEE and of moline see add 02 LESSORS 08 LESSEE leave ten 01 and SPEARS 0 9 rate see see does milk y 99 apse | 99 ho is A 09 08 of 06 05 of 03 02 of 8 be Mass fraction milk FIGURE 23.7 System acetone-MIK-water at 25Â°C. after other white and Trueger.")

As the overall acetone content of the mixture increases the compositions of the two phases approach each other and they become equal at point i the plait point The tie lines in fig 23.7 slope up to the left and the extract phase is richer in ace tone than the raffinate phase This suggests that most of the acetone could be extracted from the water phase using only a moderate amount of solvent If the tie lines were horizontal or sloped up to the right as they are in fig 23.8, extraction would still be possible but more solvent would have to be used since the final extract would not be as rich in the desired component acetone in fig 23.7 and much in fig 23.8). For the system illustrated in fig 23.7, the ratio of the product acetone to the diluent water should be high for a practical extraction process The solubility of water in milk solvent is only 2 percent but as the acetone concentration increases the water content of the extract phase also increases The data from fig 23.7 are replotted in fig 23.9 to show the gradual increase in water content yo with acetone content you The ratio y4/yu,0 goes through a maximum at about 27 weight percent acetone in the extract phase A higher concentration of acetone could be obi trained but the greater amount of water in the extract product would probably make operation at these conditions undesirable

The phase compositions resulting from a single-stage extraction are easily obi trained using the triangular diagram For example if a mixture with 40 percent ace tone and 60 percent water is contacted with an equal mass of milk solvent the over all mixture is represented by point M in fig 23.7. A new tie line is drawn to show that the extract phase would be 0.232 acetone 0.043 water and 0.725 mike The raffinate phase would be 0.132 acetone 0.845 water and 0.023 mike Repeated contacting of the raffinate phase with fresh solvent a process called crosscurrent extraction would permit recovery of most of the acetone but this would be less efficient than using a countercurrent cascade because of the large volume of solvent needed The ratio of acetone to water in the product is 5.4; that in the raffinate is 0.156. The corresponding numbers for point M in fig 23.8, the ratio of much to n-heptane, are 3.3 in the product and 1.6 in the raffinate The separation is clearly more effect give in the MIK-acetone-water system Use of McCabe-Thiele method The separation achieved for a given number of ideal stages in a counterblow cascade can be determined by using a triangular diagram and special graphical techniques but a modified McCabe-Thiele method which is the approach used here is simple to use and has satisfactory accuracy for most cases The method focuses on the concentration of solute in the extract and raffinate phases and the diagram does not show the concentration of the diluent in the extract or the concent ration of solvent in the raffinate however these minor components of both phases are accounted for in determining the total flow of extract and raffinate which affects the position of the operating line To apply the McCabe-Thiele method to extraction the equilibrium data are shown on a rectangular graph where the mass fraction of solute in the extract or V phase is plotted as the ordinate and the mass fraction of solute in the raffinate phase as the abscissa For a type I system the equilibrium line ends with equal come positions at the plait point The use of only one concentration to characterize a

To emphasize the analogy between this method and fractionation it is assumed that the cascade is a plate column Any other kind of cascade however may be used The method requires that sufficient solvent be removed from the extract leaving the cascade to form a raffinate part of which is returned to the cascade as reflux the remainder being withdrawn from the plant as a product Raffinate is withdrawn from the cascade as bottoms product and fresh solvent is admitted directly to the bottom of the cascade None of the bottom raffinate needs to be returned as reflux for the number of stages required is the same whether or not any of the raffinate is recycled to the bottom of the cascade's The situation is not the same as in continue out distillation in which part of the bottoms must be vaporized to supply heat to the column The solvent separator which is ordinarily a still is shown in fig 23.11. As also shown in fig 23.11, solvent may be removed from both products by stripping or in some cases by water washing to give solvent-free products The close analogy between distillation and extraction both using reflux is shown in Table 23.3.

For systems such as aniline-heptane-methylcyclohexane fig 23.8), the ratio of much to heptane in the extract is only modestly greater than in the raffia nates so a great many stages would be needed for high-purity products furthermore the low solubility of both solutes in aniline would mean a very large flow of solvent to be handled however a modification of the reflux concept has been applied in several industrial processes for extractive separation Enrichment of the extract is accomplished by countercurrent washing with another liquid chosen so that the small amounts of this liquid that dissolve in the extract can be easily removed The sulfonate process for extraction of aromatics is an example of this type sulfonate process A flow sheet for the sulfonate process is shown in fig 23.12.

CHAPTER 23: Leaching and Extraction 789 the heavy solvent is fed at the top In the top section nearly all the aromatics are extracted from the raffinate but the solvent at this point also contains a few percent paraffin and naphthenes. The boiling point ranges overlap so preparation of pure aromatics by distillation of this material is not practical also sulfonate and the hydrocarbons form a type I system with a plait point so paraffin-free aromatics cannot be obtained by refluxing some of the solvent-free extract product In the lower section of the extractor medium and high-boiling paraffin are displaced from the extract phase by contact with a low-boiling hydrocarbon fraction prepared by distillation of the extract Water is present in this system and forms a low-boiling azeotrope with the lighter hydrocarbons so the distillation is actually an allotropic distillation see chap 22). Vapors from the column are condensed and separated into two phases and the hydrocarbon phase is returned to the extract tor as backwash In the lower section of the extractor enough stages are provided for nearly complete transfer of the medium and heavy paraffin to the raffinate phase The extract leaves saturated with light hydrocarbons but these are removed in the allotropic distillation column Solvent is recovered in the second distillation column which is a vacuum steam distillation column with reflux of the organic phase to get high-purity aromatics The final column is a multistage extraction column where water is used to wash the solvent from the raffinate There is a closed cycle for water to minimize solvent loss and a small amount of water can be tolerated in the extraction solvent The backwash stream is sometimes called countersolvent or reflux but the term reflux should be reserved for streams having the same composition as the product The backwash need not be a low-molecular-weight material in one version of the sulfonate process the backwash is a heavy paraffinic fraction which is easily removed from both extract and raffinate SPECIAL EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES Special techniques have been developed to enhance the effectiveness of extraction processes especially in the recovery of sensitive biological products These include extraction using only aqueous phases and hypercritical fluid extraction using solvents held at a pressure and temperature above the critical point of the solvent Use of aqueous phases This method separates proteins by partitioning them between two aqueous phases which contain mutually incompatible polymers or other solutes In one such system the light phase is water containing 10 percent polyethylene glycol and about } percent dextran and the heavy phase is water with 15 percent dextran and 1 percent glycol Solutions of potassium phosphate can be used instead of dextran for the heavy phase In these liquids the proteins are not likely to be denatured as they might be in organic solvents Proteins are partitioned between the phases with district button coefficients that depend on the oh and can vary from 0.0] to more than 100. The interfacial tension is very low for these systems and large surface areas can be created without high shear rates A disadvantage is that the density difference

CHAPTER 24 Drying of Solids In general drying a solid means the removal of relatively small amounts of water or other liquid from the solid material to reduce the content of residual liquid to an acceptably low value Drying is usually the final step in a series of operations and the product from a dryer is often ready for final packaging Water or other liquids may be removed from solids mechanically by presses or centrifuges or thermally by vaporization This chapter is restricted to drying by thermal vaporization It is generally cheaper to remove liquid mechanically than thermally and thus it is advisable to reduce the liquid content as much as practical be before feeding the material to a heated dryer The liquid content of a dried substance varies from product to product ocean signally the product contains no liquid and is called bone-dry. More commonly the product does contain some liquid Dried table salt for example contains about 0.5 percent water dried coal about 4 percent and dried casein about 8 percent Dryness is a relative terms and drying means merely reducing the moisture content from an initial value to some acceptable final value The solids to be dried may be in many different forms flakes granules crystals powders slabs or continuous sheetsâand may have widely differing properties The liquid to be vaporized may be on the surface of the solid as in drying salt crystals it may be entirely inside the solid as in solvent removal from a sheet of polymer or it may be partly outside and partly inside The feed to some dryers is a liquid in which the solid is suspended as particles or is in solution The dried product such as salt and other inorganic solids may be able to stand rough handling and high temperatures or it may like food or pharmaceuticals require gentle treatment at low or moderate temperatures consequently a multitude of types of dryers are on the market for commercial drying They differ chiefly in the way the solids are moved through the drying zone and in the way heat is transferred 796

CHAPTER 24; Drying of Solids 797 Classification of dryers There is no simple way of classifying drying equipment Some dryers are con tenuous and others operate batchwise; some agitate the solids and others are es mentally unagitated. Operation under vacuum may be used to reduce the drying temperature Some dryers can handle almost any kind of material while others are severely limited in the type of feed they can accept Major divisions may be made among (1) dryers in which the solid is directly exposed to a hot gas usually air (2) dryers in which heat is transferred to the solid from an external medium such as condensing steam usually through a metal surface with which the solid is in contact and (3) dryers that are heated by dielectric radio ants or microwave energy Dryers that expose the solids to a hot gas are called adiabatic or direct dryers those in which heat is transferred from an external medium are known as nonadiabatic or indirect dryers Some units have more than one mode of heat transfer such as hot gas plus a heated surface or hot gas plus radiation Solids handling in dryers Most industrial dryers handle particulate solids during part of or all the drying cycle although some of course dry large individual pieces such as ceramic ware or sheets of polymer The properties of particulate solids are discussed in chap 28. Here it is important only to describe the different patterns of motion of solid part clues through dryers as a basis for understanding the principles of drying discussed in the next section In adiabatic dryers the solids are exposed to the gas in the following ways 1. Gas is blown across the surface of a bed or slab of solids or across one or both faces of a continuous sheet or film This process is called cross-circulation drying fig 24.1a). 2. Gas is blown through a bed of coarse granular solids that are supported on a screen This is known as through-circulation drying As in cross-circulation drying the gas velocity is kept low to avoid any entrainment of solid particles fig 24.15). 3. Solids are showered downward through a slowly moving gas stream often with some undesired entrainment of fine particles in the gas fig 24.]c). Note that some rotary dryers are nonadiabatic. 4 Gas passes through the solids at a velocity sufficient to fluidize the bed as discussed in chap 7. Inevitably there is some entrainment of finer particles fig 24.14). 5. The solids are all entrained in a high-velocity gas stream and are pneumatically conveyed from a mixing device to a mechanical separator fig 24. let 6. Drops of solution or slurry are evaporated by suspending them briefly in a hot gas stream as in spray dryers fig 24.13). In nonadiabatic dryers the only gas to be removed is the vaporized water or sold vent although sometimes a small amount of sweep gas often air or nitrogen is

Solids are spread over a stationary or slowly moving horizontal surface and cooked until dry The surface may be heated electrically or by a heat-transfer fluid such as steam or hot water alternatively heat may be supplied by a radiant heater above the solid 2. Solids are moved over a heated surface usually cylindrical by an agitator or a screw or paddle conveyor 3. Solids slide by gravity over an inclined heated surface or are carried upward with the surface for a time and then slide to a new location see rotary dryers pa 818.) PRINCIPLES OF DRYING Because of the wide variety of materials that are dried in commercial equipment and the many types of equipment used there is no single theory of drying that covers all materials and dryer types Variations in shape and size of stock in moisture

In a batch dryer with a heating medium at constant temperature fig 24.2a), the temperature of the wet solids rises rather quickly from its initial value the to the initial vaporization temperature 7,. In a nonadjabatic dryer with no sweep gas the is essentially the boiling point of the liquid at the pressure prevailing in the dryer If a sweep gas is used or if the dryer is adiabatic i is at or near the wet-bulb tempera sure of the gas which equals the adiabatic saturation temperature if the gas is air and water is the liquid being evaporated Drying may occur at 7), for a considerable time but often after a short time the temperature of the wet solids gradually rises as a zone of dry solids forms near the surface The vaporization temperature then de pends on the heat and mass-transfer resistances in the dry zone as well as on those in the external boundary layer In the final stages of drying the solids temperature rises rapidly to some higher value T,,. The drying time indicated in fig 24.2a may range from a few seconds to many hours The solids may be at 7), for most of the drying cycle or for only a small face ton of it The temperature of the heating medium is often constant as shown or it may be programmed to change as drying proceeds Heating medium the The o o no 5 5 : ! . 5 The we my i / Solid of we , Time Percent of dryer length (9) be FIGURE 24.2 Temperature patterns in dryers a batch dryer be continuous countercurrent adiabatic dryer

Curves of this type are nearly independent of temperature The abscissas of such curves are readily converted to absolute humidifies in mass of vapor per unit mass of dry gas a liquid content expressed in this way is said to be on a dry basis it may and often does exceed 100 percent

SECTION ivy Mass Transfer and Its Applications exerts an abnormally low vapor pressure because of the highly concave surface of the meniscus Adsorbents such as silica or alumina have monolayers of water strongly adsorbed on the surface and this water has a much lower vapor pressure than liquid water Beds of nonporous particles such as sand have negligible equilib- rum moisture content in humid air unless the particles are so small that the fillets of liquid where particles touch have a very small radius of curvature In fluid phases diffusion is governed by concentration differences expressed in mole fractions In a wet solid however the term mole fraction may have little meaning and for ease in drying calculations the moisture content is nearly always expressed in mass of water per unit mass of bone-dry solid This practice is followed throughout this chapter Equilibrium moisture and free moisture The air entering a dryer is seldom completely dry but contains some moisture and has a definite relative humidity For air of definite humidity the moisture content of the solid leaving the dryer cannot be less than the equilibrium moist sure content corresponding to the humidity of the entering air That portion of the water in the wet solid that cannot be removed by the inlet air because of the hug mighty of the latter is called the equilibrium moisture The free water is the difference between the total water content of the solid and the equilibrium water content thus it xu is the total moisture content and if xu is the equilibrium moisture content the free moisture X is X ex i xu It is xu rather than xu that is of interest in drying calculations Some writers use the term bound water to refer to moisture contents less than the equilibrium moisture content of a solid at 100 percent relative humidity and unbound water as moisture contents greater than this value CROSS-CIRCULATION DRYING When both heat and mass transfer are involved the mechanism of drying depends on the nature of the solids and on the method of contacting the solids and gas Solids are of three kinds crystalline porous and nonporous Crystalline particles contain no interior liquid and drying occurs only at the surface of the solid A bed of such particles of course can be considered a highly porous solid Truly porous solids such as catalyst pellets contain liquid in interior channels Nonporous solids in clue colloidal gels such as soap glue and plastic clay dense cellular solids such as wood and leather and many polymeric materials Mass transfer between the solid surface and the gas is covered by the relations discussed in chap 17. The drying rate of solids containing internal liquid however depends on the way the liquid moves and on the distance it must travel to reach the surface This is especially important in cross-circulation drying of slabs or beds of

After a short period during which the feed material is heated to the vaporization temperature the graph becomes nearly linear then curves toward the horizontal and finally levels off The drying rate which is the derivative of curve a is shown by graph be the rate is constant or decreasing slightly for a considerable period This time is often referred to as the constant-rate period even though the driving rate may decrease somewhat Next comes the falling-rate period in which the drying rate may decrease linearly with time or may give plots that are concave upward or concave downward depending on the nature of the solid and the mocha nisi of the internal moisture flow sometimes as in fig 24.6 for drying a porous ceramic plate there are two falling-rate periods A true constant-rate period is expected if the solid is so wet that a continuous film of liquid exists over the entire external surface The rate of evaporation is then about the same as that from a pool of quid and if heat transfer is only by convection through the gas film the gas-liquid interface and the solid surface are at the wet-bulb o FIGURE 24.4 Q Typical plots of total moisture 2 content and drying rate versus 2 A drying time we S 2 | so g | Drying rate 2 8 Total moisture 3 content qi 2 | | 0 i time

It differs somewhat from the theoretical distribution mainly because the diffusivity varies considerably with moisture content and is especially sensitive to shrinkage Equation (17.49) has long been used in estimating the rate of drying of nonporous solids.'Â°'Â® Materials drying in this way are said to be drying by diffusion although the actual mechanism is probably considerably more complicated than simple diffusion Diffusion is characteristic of slow-drying materials The resistance to mass transfer of water vapor from the solid surface to the air is often negligible and diffusion in the solid controls the overall drying rate The moisture content at the

It shows a dish tint break in the falling-rate curve at a moisture content of 0.05 bib of dry solid point can This has been called a second critical point The type of behavior shown in this figure however is not common for the constant rate is rarely truly constant and although there may be some change in the falling rate at low moisture contents the transition is not distinct enough to indicate a second critical moisture content Calculation of drying time under constant drying conditions For drying under constant conditions the time of drying can be determined from the drying-rate curve if it can be constructed Often the only source of this curve is a laboratory experiment on the material to be dried and this gives the dry in time directly for the laboratory conditions Drying-rate curves for these condo tons may be modified for other conditions such as a different temperature gas velocity or sample dimension and the new drying time predicted By definition dm made re i i (24.14) at A do Integrating end (24.14) between xu and xu the initial and final free-moisture con tents respectively gives my [*' do the = i (24.15) any R where fa is the total drying time Equation (24.15) may be integrated numerically from the rate-of-drying curve or analytically if equations are available giving R as a function of xu In the constant-rate period R = re and the drying time is simply m.(X, i X tog my = do (24.16) are In the falling-rate period the drying rate curve may be convex upwards which means that the drying rate falls less rapidly than the moisture content of the solid AS an approximation the drying rate can be assumed proportional to the moisture content Then real (24.17) From end (24.14) x = make (24.18) aX = ââ- . at

Although the solids loading in Example 24.2 is only 40 percent of that in Example 24.1, the amount of solids dried per unit time with through-circulation drying is more than 20 times as much as with cross-circulation drying It is true that this is for constant-rate drying but drying rates in the falling-rate period are also enhanced primarily because of the reduction in diffusion distance Drying of Suspended Particles The rate of heat transfer from a gas to a single particle may be estimated from end (12.64), provided the velocity difference between the particle or gas is known Rates of mass transfer from the surface of a solid particle or drop may be found from end (17.75) or from fig 17.7. often as in a tower dryer or rotary dryer only part of the drying is done while the particles are being showered through the gas and such dryers are therefore designed using empirical equations she rotary dryers page 818). Transfer to suspended particles is estimated from an equation like end (17.75), it is often appropriate simply to assume that the mussels or sourwood number is 2.0, the limit for a relative velocity of zero As discussed water under fluidized dryers however it is not always possible to calculate an average temperature difference or

This temperature is determined by a balance between the rate of heat transfer through the dry zone and the external gas film and the rate of mass transfer of water vapor through the same regions This is similar to the balance reached in measuring the wet-bulb temperature of a gas but in freeze-drying, the resistance to heat transfer and mass transfer increase with time Temperature and partial pressure profiles are sketched in fig 24.7 for a material being dried from both sides Screens or ribs between the material and the heating Ice front FIGURE 24.7 a ~ Gradients in freeze-drying. i " ) to | { Dry zone Screen for escape of vapor

Coarse granular flaky or fibrous materials can be dried by through circus nation without any pretreatment and without loss of material through the screen Pastes and filter cakes of fine particles however must be preformed before they can be handled on a screen-conveyor dryer The aggregates usually retain their shape while being dried and do not dust through the screen except in small amounts pro vision is sometimes made for recovering any fines that do sift through the screen Screen-conveyor dryers handle a variety of solids continuously and with a very gentle action their cost is reasonable and their steam consumption is low typically 2 keg of steam per kilogram of water evaporated Air may be recirculated through and vented from each section separately or passed from one section to another countercurrent to the solid These dryers are particularly applicable when the dry in conditions must be appreciably changed as the moisture content of the solid is reduced They are designed by methods similar to that illustrated in Example 24.2. Tower dryers A tower dryer contains a series of circular trays mounted one above the other on a central rotating shaft Solid feed dropped on the topmost tray is exposed to a stream of hot air or gas that passes across the tray The solid is then scraped off and dropped to the tray below It travels in this way through the dryer discharging as dry product from the bottom of the tower The flow of solids and gas may be either part alley or countercurrent Some mixing of the solids occurs as material is scraped off each tray so the final solids are more uniform than with other tray dryers The turbodryer illustrated in fig 24.10 is a tower dryer with internal recirculate ton of the heating gas Turbine fans circulate the air or gas outward between some of the trays over heating elements and inward between other trays Gas velocities are commonly 0.6 to 2.4 mes i to 8 ft/s). The bottom two trays of the dryer shown in fig 24.10 constitute a cooling section for dry solids Preheated air is usually drawn in the bottom of the tower and discharged from the top giving countercurrent flow A turbodryer functions partly by cross-circulation drying as in a tray dryer and partly by showering the particles through the hot gas as they tumble from one tray to another Rotary dryers rotary dryer consists of a revolving cylindrical shell horizontal or slightly in lined toward the outlet Wet feed enters one end of the cylinder dry material dish charges from the other As the shell rotates internal flights lift the solids and shower them down through the interior of the shell Rotary dryers are heated by direct con tact of gas with the solids by hot gas passing through an external jacket or by steam condensing in a set of longitudinal tubes mounted on the inner surface of the shell

Dryer capacities however especially with fine particles are best established by experiment The exit gas is nearly always saturated with vapor for any allowable fluidization velocity Dryers of the kind shown in fig 24.12 may also be operated batchwise. A charge of wet solids in a perforated container attached to the bottom of the fluidize in chamber is fluidized heated until dry then discharged Such units have replaced tray dryers in many processes Flash dryers in flash dryer a wet pulverized solid is transported for a few seconds in a hot gas stream Drying takes place during transportation The rate of heat transfer from the gas to the suspended solid particles is high and drying is rapid so that no more than 3 or is is required to evaporate substantially all the moisture from the solid The temperature of the gas is high---often about 650Â°C (1.200Â°F) at the inletâbut the time of contact is so short that the temperature of the solid rarely rises more than 50Â°C (90Â°F) during drying Flash drying may therefore be applied to sensitive man trials that in other dryers would have to be dried indirectly by a much cooler heat in medium Sometimes a pulverized is incorporated in the flash drying system to give simultaneous drying and size reduction Dryers for Solutions and flurries A few types of dryers evaporate solutions and scurries entirely to dryness by thermal means Typical examples are spray dryers thin-film dryers and drum dryers Spray dryers in spray dryer a slurry or liquid solution is dispersed into a stream of hot gas in the form of a mist of fine droplets Moisture is rapidly vaporized from the droplets leaving residual particles of dry solid which are then separated from the

The time required to dry a drop of known diameter however depends not only on A but also on the mixing pattern In a dryer with a low ratio of height to diameter as in fig 24.13, there is a considerable amount of mixing near the top and the average temperature-difference driving force is less than that for true parallel flow It is essential however to evaporate to dryness the largest drop not the avert age drop Usually in calculating drying times it may be assumed that the diameter of the largest drop is twice the value of do found from end (24.24). Average drop diameters in a spray dryer range from 20 am when a disk atom sizer is used to 180 am with a coarse spray nozzle Residence times vary from 3 to is in concurrent dryers to as much as 25 to is in countercurrent dryers The chief advantages of spray dryers are the very short drying time which per its drying of highly heat-sensitive materials and the production of solid or hollow spherical particles The desired consistency bulk density appearance and flow properties of some products such as foods or synthetic detergents may be difficult or impossible to obtain in any other type of dryer Spray dryers also have the add vantage of yielding from a solution slurry or thin paste in a single step a dry prod cut that is ready for the package A spray dryer may combine the functions of an evaporator a crystallized a dryer a size reduction unit and a classifier Where one can be used the resulting simplification of the overall manufacturing process may be considerable Considered as dryers alone spray dryers are not highly efficient Much heat is ordinarily lost in the discharged gases They are bulky and very large often 25 m (80 to or more high and are not always easy to operate The bulk density of the dry solid property of especial importance in packaged productsâis often difficult to keep constant for it may be highly sensitive to changes in the solids content of the feed to the inlet gas temperature and to other variables.'* In spray-drying solutions the evaporation from the surface of the drops leads to initial deposition of solute at the surface before the interior of the drop reaches sat ration The rate of diffusion of solute back into the drop is slower than the flow of water from the interior to the surface and the entire solute content accumulates at the surface The final dry particles are often hollow and the product from a spray dryer is quite porous Thin-film dryers Competitive with spray dryers in some situations are thin-film dryers which can accept a liquid or a slurry feed and produce a dry free-flowing solid product

Selection of Drying Equipment The first consideration in selecting a dryer is its operability above all else the equipment must produce the desired product in the desired form at the desired rate Despite the variety of commercial dryers on the market the various types are largely complementary not competitive and the nature of the drying problem dick takes the type of dryer that must be used or at least limits the choice to perhaps two or three possibilities The final choice is then made on the basis of capital and opera eating costs Attention must be paid however to the costs of the entire isolation system not just the drying unit alone Thermal efficiency The thermal efficiency of a dryer can be destined as the percentage of the energy supplied that is used in evaporating the water or solvent The efficiency can be call curated from the energy losses which include the sensible heat of the warm moist air that is vented the sensible heat of the discharged solids and the heat loss to the surroundings For the through-circulation dryer of Example 24.2, if nearly dry air at 70Â°F is heated to 160Â°F and moist air vented at the = 80 i 15.8 = 95.8Â°F, the

, CHAPTER 25 Adsorption and Fixed-Bed Separations In several processes for separating gaseous or liquid mixtures the fluid is contacted with small particles of a porous solid which selectively adsorbs or complexes with certain components of the feed In adsorption the solid is usually held in fixed bed and fluid is passed continuously through the bed until the solid is nearly saturated The flow is then switched to a second bed and the saturated bed is replaced or regenerated Ion exchange is another process that is carried out in this semibatch fashion in a fixed bed Water to be softened or deionized is passed over beds of ion-exchange resin until the resin becomes nearly saturated For both adsorption and ion exchange continuous countercurrent operation could be achieved by moving the solids through the bed and continuously replacing spent particles with fresh ones however this method of operation is not often used because it is difficult to get uniform flow of solids Chromatography is a process similar to adsorption in that gas or liquid mixtures are passed through a bed of porous particles but the feed is introduced in small pulses rather than continuously The individual components move through the bed at different rates and are collected at the exit The bed is continuously regenerated by passage of the carrier gas or liquid and can be operated for long periods but only small amounts of the feed mixture are separated at a time For all these processes the performance depends on fluid-solid equilibria and on mass-transfer rates which are discussed in the following sections ADSORPTION Adsorbents and adsorption processes Most adsorbents are highly porous materials and adsorption takes place primary fly on the walls of the pores or at specific sites inside the particles Because the pores are generally very small the internal surface area is orders of magnitude greater than 836

Separation occurs because differ fences in molecular weight shape or polarity cause some molecules to be held more strongly on the surface than others or because the pores are too small to admit the larger molecules In many cases the adsorbing component for adsorbate is held strongly enough to permit complete removal of that component from the fluid with very little adsorption of other components Regeneration of the adsorbent can then be carried out to obtain the adsorbate in concentrated or nearly pure form Applications of vapor-phase adsorption include the recovery of organic sold vents used in paints printing inks and solutions for film casting or fabric coating The solvent-laden air may first be sent to a water-cooled or refrigerated condenser to collect some of the solvent but it is generally impractical to cool the gas far below ambient temperature in an attempt to eliminate solvent losses The air with a small amount of solvent is passed through a bed of carbon adsorbent particles which can reduce the solvent concentration to less than | ppm The concentration may be set by government emission standards rather than by the economics of solvent recovery Adsorption on carbon is also used to remove pollutants such as is cs and other odorous compounds from air circulating in ventilation systems and canisters of carbon are placed in most new automobiles to prevent gasoline vapors from being vented to the air Drying of gases is often carried out by adsorbing the water on silica gel alumina or other inorganic porous solids The zeolites or molecular sieves which are natural or synthetic aluminosilicates with a very regular fine pore structure are especially effective in preparing gases with low dew points (â75Â°C). Adsorption on molecular sieves can also be used to separate oxygen and nitrogen to prepare pure hydrogen from synthesis gas and to separate normal paraffin from branched paraffin and aromatics Adsorption from the liquid phase is used to remove organic components from drinking water or aqueous wastes colored impurities from sugar solutions and veg table oils and water from organic liquids Adsorption can also be used to recover reaction products that are not easily separated by distillation or crystallization Some of the same types of solids are used for both vapor-phase and liquid-phase adsorb tiny though often adsorbents with larger pores are preferred for use with liquids ADSORPTION EQUIPMENT Fixed-bed absorbers A typical system used for adsorption of solvent vapors is shown in fig 25.1. The adsorbent particles are placed in a bed 0.3 to 1.2 m i to 4 to deep supported on a screen or perforated plate The feed gas passes down through one of the beds while the other is being regenerated Downflow is preferred because flow at high rates might fluidize the particles causing attrition and loss of finest When the concentration of solute in the exit gas reaches a certain value or at a scheduled time valves are automatically switched to direct the feed to the other bed and initiate the regeneration sequence

By using a longer bed the adsorption cycle could be extended to several days but the higher pressure drop and the greater capital cost of the absorber would probe by make this uneconomical Using a bed only 0.3 m i to or less in depth is sometimes recommended to decrease the pressure drop and the size of the absorbers but shallow beds do not give as complete a separation and require more energy for regeneration Gas-drying equipment The equipment for drying gases is similar to that shown in fig 25.1, but hot gas is used for regeneration The moist gas from the bed being regenerated may be vented or much of the water may be removed in a condenser and the gas recirculated through a heater to the bed For small dryers electric heaters are sometimes installed inside the bed to provide the energy for regeneration When regeneration is carried out at a much lower pressure than adsorption it may not be necessary to supply heat since low pressure favors desorption If a gas dryer operates at several atmospheres pressure during the adsorption cycle nearly complete regeneration can be accomplished by passing part of the dry gas through the bed at atmospheric pressure without preheating Some of the heat of adsorption

The particles of carbon adsorb some pollutants that are not biodegradable but there is also a syne fistic effect of having adsorption and biological treatment taking place together Some compounds that are not biodegradable and are weakly adsorbed can be almost completely removed by the PACT process The amount of carbon added to the waste stream varies from 10 ppm to over 1,000 ppm depending on the nature of the waste and effluent standards A settling tank is used after the treatment tank and by recycling some of the thickened layer the care on concentration can be increased and the residence time of carbon in the system made several times the hydraulic residence time The price of powdered carbon is only half that of granular carbon and is a small part of the operating cost In large plants the carbon cost can be further reduced by wet air regeneration at 250Â°C, which destroys the biomass and most of the adsorbed species but only about 10 percent of the carbon equilibria Adsorption Isotherms The adsorption isotherm is the equilibrium relationship between the concentration in the fluid phase and the concentration in the adsorbent particles at a given temperature For gases the concentration is usually given in mole percent or as a partial pressure For liquids the concentration is often expressed in mass units such as meal ppm or gal (ppb). The concentration of adsorbate on the solid is given as mass add sorbed per unit mass of original adsorbent Types of isotherms Some typical isotherm shapes are shown as arithmetic graphs in fig 25.2. The linear isotherm goes through the origin and the amount adsorbed is proportional to the concentration in the fluid isotherms that are convex upward are called favorable because a relatively high solid loading can be obtained at low concentration in the fluid The languid isotherm is given by the relation W = W,,,,[Ke/(1 + Ke)], where W is the adsorbate loading i is the concentration in the fluid and K is the adsorption constant This isotherm is of the favorable type When K is large and Kc i i the isotherm is strongly favorable and when Kc < i the isotherm is nearly linear The languid isotherm is derived assuming a uniform surfaceânota valid assumption but the relation works fairly well for gases that are weakly adsorbed For strongly far vocable isotherms the empirical Freundlich equation W = bcâ, where b and m are constants and m < i is often a better fit particularly for adsorption from liquids The limiting case of a very favorable isotherm is irreversible adsorption where the amount adsorbed is independent of concentration down to very low values All systems show a decrease in the amount adsorbed with an increase in temperature and of course adsorbate can be removed by raising the temperature even for the cases labeled

At time i when the concentration reaches some limiting permissible value or break point the low is stopped or diverted to a fresh adsorbent bed The break point is often taken as a relative concentration of 0.05 or 0.10, and since only the last portion of fluid processed has this high a concentration the average fraction of solute removed from the start to the break point is often 0.99 or higher If adsorption were continued beyond the break point the concentration would rise rapidly to about 0.5 and then more slowly approach 1.0, as shown in fig 25.60. This shaped curve is similar to those for the internal concentration profiles and it is often nearly symmetric By material balance it can be shown that the area be tween the curve and a line at city = 1.0 is proportional to the total solute adsorbed if the entire bed comes to equilibrium with the feed The amount adsorbed is also proportional to the rectangular area to the left of the dashed line at 1â. the ideal add sorption time for a vertical breakthrough curve For a symmetric curve fa is also the time when coco reaches 0.5.

Laboratory tests using higher than expected concentrations of a pollutant may be made to shorten the time for a breakthrough test Very large differences in concentration may lead to errors in scale because of a change in the mass-transfer coefficient or because of temperature effects Adsorption is an exothermic process and a bed temperature rise of 10 to 50Â°C may result when treating vapors with only | percent adsorbable component In small-diameter beds heat loss will limit the temperature rise but a large unit will operate almost adiabatically and significant differences in performance could results In such cases a large-diameter pilot column should be used or detailed calculations made to account for heat release and heat transfer in the bed Basic Equations for Adsorption Although absorbers are generally designed from laboratory data the approximate performance can sometimes be predicted from equilibrium data and mass-transfer calculations In this section the basic equations are presented for isothermal adsorb ton in fixed beds and solutions are given for some limiting cases This material can give insight into factors affecting the width of the mass-transfer zone in an absorbers Rate of mass transfer Equations for mass transfer in fixed-bed adsorption are obtained by making a solute material balance for a section do of the bed as shown in fig 25.9.

The slope increases with time and city becomes 1.0 at vet i i = 1.0. In practice the break through curves are usually S-shaped, because the internal diffusion resistance is not negligible and it increases somewhat when the solid becomes nearly saturated If pore diffusion controls the rate of adsorption the breakthrough curve has the opposite shape from that for external-film control The corresponding line in fig 25.11 was taken from the work of Hall et al.,â? who presented breakthrough curves for several cases of irreversible adsorption For pore diffusion control the initial slope of the curve is high because the solid near the front of the mass-transfer zone has almost no adsorbate and the average diffusion distance is a very small fraction of the particle radius The curve has a long tail because the final molecules adsorbed have to diffuse almost to the center of the particles When both internal and external resistances are significant the breakthrough curve is S-shaped, as shown by the dashed line in fig 25.11.

For adsorption with a linear isotherm a very long bed is required to make the transfer zone a small fraction of the bed width in contrast to adsorption with a favorable isotherm For example if N = 10, fig 25.12 shows the 5 percent break point would be reached at t = 0.35. and only about 35 percent of the bed capacity would be utilized Doubling the bed length to make N = 20 raises t at the break wait to only 0.50, and N would have to be more than 100 to utilize 80 percent of the bed capacity For irreversible adsorption with equal internal and external resist dances no 10 gives not i i = -1.6 or t = 0.84 at the break point Favorable adsorption For favorable adsorption the break point occurs between the values predicted for linear adsorption and irreversible adsorption Solutions are available for certain isotherm shapes and different values of internal and external resistances.'>?> These solutions have found use for the design of ion exchangers where the solid-fluid equilibria and the internal diffusivities are more readily characterized than for adsorption absorber Design The design of an absorber for gas or liquid purification involves choosing the adsorbent and the particle size selecting an appropriate velocity to get the bed area and either determining the bed length for a given cycle time or calculating the break through time for a chosen length Using a shorter bed length means a smaller invent try of sorbet and lower pressure drop in the bed however the shorter bed means more frequent regeneration and higher regeneration costs since a smaller fraction of the bed is saturated at breakthrough For gas purification 4 x i or 4 x 10-mesh carbon is often chosen but smaller sizes can be used when better mass transfer is needed and pressure drop is not a problem The gas velocity is usually between 15 and 60 comes (0.5 and 2 ft/s).

The axial dispersion is some what greater than for a fixed bed because of particle motion but moderately steep breakthrough curves can still be obtained.'Â°4 Regeneration There have been few published studies of regeneration kinetics since it is if fault to match conditions for a large adiabatic bed in a laboratory absorbers and modeling is complicated because the desorption isotherm is nonlinear and unsavory able For steam regeneration of carbon reverse flow is generally used with steam at 130 to 150Â°C. Regeneration is stopped soon after the temperature front reaches the top of the bed and the typical steam consumption is 0.2 to 0.4 i steam/Ib carbon Although a significant amount of adsorbate remains regeneration is most complete near the bottom of the bed so that a high percentage removal can still be achieved in the next adsorption period If extremely high solute removal is needed the bed can be almost completely regenerated by prolonging the steaming period or using higher-temperature steam For some processes where adsorption is used to recover a valuable product regeneration by thermal-swing desorption is not feasible because the high temp creature needed for desorption would degrade the product An alternative is to displace the adsorbate by a gas or liquid which is moderately strongly adsorbed and can be easily separated from the product A number of materials may be suit able for displacement regeneration since an adsorbate can be nearly completely displaced by another species even if the displacing substance is less strongly adsorbed The exon process for separation of medium-molecular-weight linear paraffin is an example of an adsorption cycle with displacement regeneration The linear molecules are removed from the liquid feed by adsorption at 300Â°C in the cavities of a molecular sieves while the branched and cyclic isomers are excluded The linear paraffin are deserved by gaseous ammonia which is moderately strongly adsorbed in spite of its low molecular weight The hydrocarbons are easily removed by condensation and the ammonia is reused The complete cycle time is 12 to 30 in depending on the concentration of linear paraffin in the feed.!â

Ion-exchange capability exists in some natural materials such as clays and zeolites but most processes use synthetic ion-exchange resins These are prepared from organic polymers such as cross-linked polystyrene to which ionizable groups have been added Cation exchangers include strong-acid resins with sulfuric acid groups (âSO;), weak-acid resins with carbolic acid groups i COO"), and other types with intermediate acid strength Anion exchangers can have strong-base quaternary ammonium groups [âN*(CH,),] or weak-base amine groups (--N*H,). In both cation and anion exchangers the acid or base groups are chemically bonded to the resin matrix and the resins have a high concentration of fixed negative or positive charges These are balanced by mobile countering such as he name or can for cation resins and club oh or not for anion resins so that electrical need reality is always maintained in the resin particles Ton exchange takes place when the activity of ions in the external solution differs from that of the mobile ions in the resin phase For example exposing a hydrogen-form resin he to a solution with navy and he will result in diffusion of some nap ions into the resin and diffusion of some he ions into the solution lon-exchange resins are insoluble in water but they swell in aqueous solution to an extent determined by the degree of cross-Jinking, the concentration of fixed charges and the concentration of electrolytes in the solution For a sulfuric acid resin with a moderate degree of cross-linking i percent divinylbenzene), the swollen volume of the napiform resin in dilute solution is about 1.8 times the vole me of the dry resin and the porosity is 45 percent This resin swells an additional 8 percent when converted to he in dilute acid solutions Some swelling is desirable to increase diffusion rates inside the particles but swelling also decreases the can pacify of the resin per unit volume of particle or per unit volume of bed Resins are available as spherical beads with sizes between 0.3 and 1.2 my and are generally used in fixed beds similar to those for adsorption from liquids Equilibria The capacity of an ion exchanger is the number of exchangeable groups per unit mass of dry resin For cation resins the capacity is often expressed as milliequivalents per gram of dry hydrogen-form resin or meg he For anion resins the basis is a gram of dry chlorine-form resin For practical purposes the capacity may be given in equivalents per liter of bed The theoretical capacity for a styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer is about 5.4 meg he when each of the aromatic rings has one sulfuric acid group The corresponding bed capacity is about 2.5 equivalents per liters

For more strongly cross linked resins which do not swell as much the effect of ion size on kid values is somewhat greater than on the values in Table 25.1. Divalent ions tend to have somewhat higher ka values than monovalent ions but in most applications the preference of the exchanger for divalent ions is greater than suggested by the equilibrium constants For very low solution con centrations, an exchange reaction of the type shown in end (25.30) can go almost completely to the right because the concentration of the monovalent ion is squared in end (25.31).

The exact shape of the breakthrough curve and the value of i are hard to predict and the design of large units is usually based on experience or tests with a small column If the particle size and liquid velocity are kept constant and care is taken to ensure uniform distribution of the feed the length of unused bed club should not change in going to a larger column With a favorable equip lithium curve the club may be only a few inches a small fraction of the normal bed length Regeneration of an exhausted bed is carried out by passing a concentrated solution of acid based or salt through the bed By using a concentrated solution the minimum regeneration time is decreased and the strong preference of the resin for multivalent ions is greatly reduced as illustrated in fig 25.15. When the equilibrium curve is almost linear the width of the mass-transfer zone increases with bed length see fig 25.12). The time for complete for nearly complete regeneration may be much greater than the minimum regeneration time but it is still considerably shorter than the breakthrough time for the solute removal part of the cycle EXAMPLE 25.7. Laboratory tests for the removal of metal ions from a 0.008 M solution using a short bed of ion-exchange beads indicated an effective bed capacity of 0.75 mmol/mL at breakthrough c = 0.02c,) compared to an equilibrium capacity of 1.15 mmol/mL.

Using counterblow of regeneration solution is more effective in removing strongly held counterions, since these tend to concentrate near the feed end of the bed however a concurrent arrangement with downflow of feed and regenerate is commonly used For preparation of very pure water both cation and anion-exchange resins are used A strong cation resin replaces the cations with he ions and in the next cold um an anion-exchange resin removes anions and produces OH i ions which react to form how Sometimes three or four beds are used in series with a combination of strong-acid, weak-acid, strong-base, and weak-base resins arranged in various ways to facilitate regeneration demonization can also be achieved with a mixed bed of cation and anion resins The beads are separated before regeneration by gentle fluidization, since the anion resins arc lighter and more easily suspended CHROMATOGRAPHY Chromatography is the name given to a class of processes for the separation of multicomponent mixtures of gases or liquids It uses a bed of solids or immobilized liquid as a stationary phase and intermittent feed of the material to be separated Components of the mixture are moved through the bed or eluted by continuous flow of a carrier gas or liquid which becomes the mobile phase Feed components part ton between the mobile and stationary phases and move at different rates through the bed because of different distribution coefficients If the bed or column is long enough all the components emerge sequentially as separate pulses and an analyzer at the exit shows the concentration of each component in the mobile phase The term chromatography arose from the bands of color seen when a glass column was used to separate liquid mixtures of plant cell pigments It is now applied to other similar separations The column analyzer and associated equipment for controlling the flow rate and temperature are called a chromatography The plot of the analyzer signal showing the peaks for each component is a chromatogram A typical chromatogram is shown in fig 25.16. chromatography are classified by the nature of the mobile and stationary phases Gas chromatography (GC) includes asci where the stationary phase is a 2 we FIGURE 25.16 | | Chromatogram for c to Cs alkyl 3 bromides by permission from 3 so at ogre and re so duvet is are Gas-Liquid chromatography i 4 5 Theory and practice Interscience, New york 1962.) 2 4 6 8 10 Time minutes

A mixture of high-molecular-weight polymers or biomaterials dissolved in a liquid is fractionated because the largest molecules are excluded from some of the pores in the stationary phase The molecules are separated by size with the largest ones coming out first and the smallest eluted last This is the opposite of the order of elution in other chromatographic processes Chromatography is used mainly as an analytical tools because the intermittent feed and small pulses of feed material make the production rate from the column quite low and the separation cost per unit of product is high There are also probe less in scaling up large columns as discussed later Large-scale or preparative chromatography is justified for some high-value products or where separation by other means is very difficult Gas-liquid chromatography In gas-liquid chromatography each component of the feed sample moves through the column at a rate proportional to the velocity of the carrier gas and in aversely proportional to the capacity of the stationary phase plus the mobile phase The equilibrium relationship for component a expressed in mole fractions is ya = PA yard (25,34) .

CHAPTER 26 Membrane Separation Processes Many processes for separation of gaseous or liquid mixtures use semipermeable membranes that allow one or more constituents of the mixture to pass through more readily than the others The membranes may be thin layers of a rigid material such as porous glass or sintered metal but more often they are flexible films of synthetic polymers prepared to have a high permeability for certain types of molecules This chapter deals with processes in which separation is due to differences in solubility's and diffusion rates through the membrane Separation of gas mixtures with porous or nonporous membranes is treated first Then several processes for liquid mixtures are discussed including pervaporation, liquid-liquid extraction reverse osmosis and dialysis The processes of ultrafiltration and microfiltration, where separation is act accomplished mainly by excluding large molecules or colloidal particles from the pores of the membrane are treated as special cases of filtration in chap 29. SEPARATION OF GASES Porous membranes When a gas mixture is allowed to diffuse through a porous membrane to a region of lower pressure the gas permeating the membrane is enriched in the lower molecular-weight components since they diffuse more rapidly When the pores are much smaller than the mean free path in the gas phase about 1,000 A at standard conditions the gases diffuse independently by Knudsen diffusion and the differ sixty in the pore is proportional to the pore size and the average molecular velocity which varies inversely with the square root of the molecular weight my For Knudsen diffusion of gas A in cylindrical pores see end (17.29)} p you is =9,700( 77) (26.1) Ma 882

One advantage of these membranes is that they can be used at higher temperatures than polymer membranes Polymer membranes The transport of gases through dense nonporous polymer membranes occurs by a solution-diffusion mechanism The gas dissolves in the polymer at the high pressure side of the membranes diffuses through the polymer phase and desorb or evaporates at the low-pressure side The rate of mass transfer depends on the concentration gradient in the membrane which is proportional to the partial press sure gradient across the membrane if the solubility is proportional to the pressure Typical gradients for a binary mixture are shown in fig 26.2. henry law is assumed to apply for each gas and equilibrium is assumed at the interface The gas-film resistances are neglected for this case so the partial pressures at the gas polymer interface are the same as those in the bulk The flux for gas A is does Cay 7 can ja = âD,| i } = day ââââ (26.5) is Z FIGURE 26,2 Car Gradients in a dense polymer membrane a pay Car Pat Car pay pay Cap we z i

The gas solubility also varies widely with the gas and the type of polymer The solubility is low for gases that have a low boiling point or critical temperature but the similarity of the gas and the polymer is also important Polar gases tend to be more soluble in polymers with a high concentration of polar groups and the solubility of water vapor is high in materials that can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules With a wide range of diffusivities and solubilities, it is not sure rising that some membranes have quite high reflectivities for certain gas mixtures For silicone rubber the selectivity is 4.9 for CO,/H, and 5.0 for CO./O,. For Kapton, an aromatic polyester divide and a glassy polymer the permeability's are three to five orders of magnitude lower than for silicone rubber and the order of permeable cities is altered.'Â® The reflectivities for laptop are 0.18 for CO,/H, and 3.1 for CO.,O,. A selectivity of 4 or greater is generally needed for a good separation as shown in a later section For most gases the permeability increases with temperature because the in crease in diffusivity more than offsets any decrease in solubility The change in permeability is often correlated with the exponential equation Q = a ex (âE/RT), with activation energies E that range from | to 5 kcal/mol. however an increase in temperature usually decreases the membrane selectivity so the operating tempera sure is determined by balancing the needs for high flux and high selectivity Membrane structure The flux through a dense polymer film is inversely proportional to the thickness [Eq. (26.7)], so there is a strong incentive to make the membrane as thin as possible without having holes or weak spots in it Gas separation processes operate with press sure differences of 1 to 20 at so the thin membrane must be supported by a porous structure capable of withstanding such pressures but offering little resistance to the flow of gas The support is made from a porous ceramic metal or polymer and it should have a porosity of about 50 percent The pore size should be comparable to

Typical asymmetric membranes are 50 to 200 yam thick with a 0.1- to 1-4Â¢m skin New techniques may permit production of commercial membranes with a skin thinner than 0.1 jump Membranes with a very thin skin are more likely to have pinholes and since flow through such flaws is very rapid compared to diffusion through dense polymer only a few pinholes per unit area can lower the selectivity ape preciably. One solution to this problem is to coat the membrane with a very permed able but nonselective polymer which fills the pinholes and does not greatly reduce the permeability of the rest of the membrane.''! The asymmetric membranes can be prepared in the form of flat sheets tubes or hollow fibers as small as 40 am in did aineter. The small hollow fibers are strong enough to withstand high pressures with out any additional support but the flat sheets need additional supports and spacers The concentration gradients in an asymmetric membrane are complex because transport through the skin layer is by molecular diffusion in the dense polymer but transport through the porous support is by diffusion plus laminar flow of gas in the tortuous pores For high-flux membranes there may also be significant mass-transfer resistances in the boundary layers on both sides where transport is also by diffusion plus flow Figure 26.4 shows pressure and concentration gradients for an asymmetric membrane For this example the permeability of A is much greater than that of be and the flux of A is several times that of be The sketch shows a slight pressure gradient for A in the feed boundary layer but the large drop in c shows that the skin has most of the resistance to mass transfer Note that the gradient for B in the boundary layer is negative and B is carried against its concentration gradient by the total flow which is mostly a

890 SECTION ivy Mass Transfer and Its Applications In some separators both ends of the fibers are open as in fig 26.56, and per meat flows from the center toward each end This makes the flow countercurrent in half of the separator and parallel in the other half This arrangement decreases the pressure drop for permeate flow inside the fibers or permits longer units to be made with the same pressure drop Sometimes there is little difference in the permeate composition for parallel or counterblow operation since the fluxes depend mainly on the feed-side partial pressures when the permeate pressure is much less than the feed pressure counterblow operation is necessary however to make a high-purity residue stream as in the production of nearly pure no from air The problem of getting good flow distribution on the shell side is alleviated by using a crossbow arrangements as in fig 26.5Â¢. The fibers are bundled around a perforated discharge pipe and feed gas flows radially from the outside of the shell to the central pipe With flow radially inward and the flow decreasing as gas permed ate the fibers there is not much change in velocity past the fibers Some comment dial separators are arranged with feed at the center and radial flow outward even though this makes the change in velocity greater from inlet to exit The fibers can be sealed in tube sheets at one or both ends of the unit crossbow also exists in spiral wound separators made with flat-sheet membranes as shown in fig 26.20a. With crossfiow, the predicted separation is not quite as good as with counterblow but it is better than with parallel flow.*â Product purity and yield The compositions of the permeate and the residue depend on many variables including the pressure difference across the membrane the composition and flow rate of the feed the permeability of the various species the total membrane area and the flow arrangements An important dependent variable is the fraction of feed that is recovered as permeates This is called the stage cure Data for permeate and residue compositions are often shown as functions of the stage cut which can be varied over a wide range by changing the pressure or the feed rate The equations derived here for the separation of a binary mixture with an asym- metric membrane are based on the assumption of negligible resistances in the porous slayer and the boundary layers The frictional pressure drops on the feed side and the permeate side are also assumed to be negligible The terminology is similar to that for distillation with x and L representing composition and flow rate on the feed side and y and V the composition and flow rate of the permeates here x and y refer to mole fractions of the more permeable species which is A in an abb binary mixture Unlike their behavior in distillation L and V change appreciably as the gases pass through the separator and by material balance the decrease in L is equal to the increase in v The feed can be inside or outside the hollow fibers and is assumed to be in plug flow so x gradually changes with length along the fiber axis as shown in fig 26.6. For the permeates also assumed to be in plug flow it is necessary to distinguish between ya the average composition of the gas at some axial position and you the local composition of the gas leaving the membrane surface at the same axial position The values of y and ya are identical at the end of the separator where the permeate flow starts but they change at different rates as permeate accumulates As shown in fig 26.6, ya increases as the permeate flows toward the discharge end because x is

Sometimes a sweep gas is added to the permeate side to improve the separation At a fixed pressure the separation improves with increasing selectivity but there is sometimes an upper limit to The partial pressure of A in the permeate can never exceed that in the feed and the maximum value of v is found by equating the partial pressures Pix > Pry = pry , x (26.19) snap = R For example for a feed with 40 percent A and a pressure ratio R = 0.5, the highest permeate concentration is 0.80 even for a very selective membrane however if the pressure ratio is decreased to 0.20, nearly pure A can be obtained if the membrane has a very high selectivity The variation of v with a is shown in fig 26.7 for two values of R and x = 0.4 or 0.2. The performance of a separator can be predicted by combining the flux equations with material balances and integrating numerically from one end of the separator to the other For an approximate prediction or an analysis of data from an operating unit it may be satisfactory to use average values of the permeate composition or the driving force The overall and component material balances for the separator are in = on + you (26.20) linden = LomXou + mom You (26.21)

CHAPTER 26: Membrane Separation Processes 899 Several companies supply permeates for air separation using membranes with characteristics similar to those in Example 26.1. One of the main applications is to provide nitrogen at purities of 95 to 99 percent which is sufficient for many inert gas requirements The air is usually fed to the lumen side to get a more uniform residence time distribution and to lower the friction pressure drop on the permeate side Figure 26.9 shows the residual oxygen concentration as a function of lot fly for an ideal counterblow separator A low oxygen concentration requires a small value of & and a large stage cut Commercial units with capacities of 3 to 1,000 much are available and for moderate nitrogen purities their performance is close to that prep diced for a = S and R = 0.1. For 99 percent purity or higher the fraction recovered is somewhat less than predicted If the goal is to make enriched oxygen for medical uses or to improve combust on only a small stage cut is used and a permeate with 40 percent to 50 percent of is obtained For enriched oxygen production the feed can be at atmospheric press sure and a vacuum pump is used to get a low value of re Then the only work needed is to compress the permeate to atmospheric pressure instead of compressing a much larger flow of air to several atmospheres Although purer oxygen can be made by using several stages in series the decompression costs make this uneconomical compared to oxygen from Jiquid-air plants or adsorption processes A combination of membrane and other technologies might be attractive for some applications Using membranes to prepare a gas with 50 percent of as feed to a pressure-swing adsorption plant would greatly increase the capacity of the adsorb berg also a gas with only a few ppm of can be produced by using membranes to get down to 0.5 percent of and then removing the oxygen with added hydrogen in a catalytic combustor There are many installations using membranes to recover hydrogen from purge streams in ammonia methanol and hydrogenation plants The reflectivities for he relative to chat cop and no are in the range of 10 to 100, and permeate consider ably enriched in he can be obtained in a single stage The compositions reported for a petrochemical application are shown in Table 26.3. in this example the feed press sure was 72 bars the residue pressure was 71 bars and the permeate pressure was 31 bars Most of the hydrogen is recovered and recycled to the synthesis plant and the residue is burned for fuel There is no need to get a very high concentration of hydrogen in the permeates In other applications hydrogen concentrations of 95 per cent to 98 percent can be obtained by taking a lower stage cut smaller recovery of he or operating with a lower pressure ration TABLE 26.3 Gas compositions for separation of ammonia plant purge gas Gas composition mom % â->TT Percentage recovery Gas Feed Residue Permeate in permeate he 59 12 86 93 my 21 43 8 24 a 6 i 3 32 chi la 34 3 i

The trick lion pressure drop on the feed side is usually small (<1 atman so two or three units can be put in series without having to decompress the feed The permeate streams differ in purity and may be used for different purposes or they may all be combined An example of this scheme is the use of two silicone membrane units in series to recover propylene from a vent gas with 15 percent chi and 85 percent not With a selectivity of 10 and pa = 200 i find absolute the first unit produces a permeate with 43 percent chi and a residue with 5.3 percent C,Hg.

CHAPTER 26: Membrane Separation Processes 907 processes One example is the use of electrodialysis to treat the reject salt solution from a reverse-osmosis system The salt concentration is increased eightfold which reduces the disposal cost and the reclaimed water is recycled to the reverse osmosis plant In this application the electrode polarity is reversed at regular intern pals to minimize scale problems at the high salt concentration Membranes for Liquid-Liquid Extraction Extraction of a solute from water to an organic liquid or vice versus can be carried out using membranes to separate the phases and provide a high surface area for mass transfer Hollow-fiber or flat-sheet membranes can be used and the mass-transfer area is then fixed by the design and does not depend on variables such as flow rate viscosity and surface tension which affect the area of liquid-liquid dispersions The membrane extractor can be arranged to have counterblow of the two phases with no flooding limitations unlike the situation in packed or spray columns A further advantage is that there is no need for a settling tank or deemulsifier. because the phases are kept separate by the membrane however the membrane does introduce an additional resistance to mass transfer and this must be minimized to make the process attractive If a dense polymer film were used in an extractor the membrane resistance would be quite large because of the very low diffusivity in solid polyiners. Using an asymmetric membrane would reduce the membrane resistance because diffusion is more rapid in the open substructure than in the dense skin however the minimum resistance is obtained with a porous membrane one that has pores extending come lately through the membrane Phase separation is maintained by choosing a memo brave that is not wetted by one of the phases For example membranes made of tension or polypropylene are hydrophobic and water will not enter the pores except at high pressure The critical entry pressure depends on the contact angle and the size and shape of the pores and is as high as 50 i find for some commercial membranes An extractor with hollow fibers of polypropylene could operate with the aqua out phase inside the fibers at a pressure slightly greater than the pressure of the organic phase on the outside The pores of the membrane would fill with the organic solvent and the liquid-liquid interface would be at the pore mouths The concentrate on gradients are sketched in fig 26.14 for an example where the equilibrium solute concentration is much higher in the organic phase The overall resistance for this case is pa belt ) 06.35) ka my make do i The coefficients for the water phase &,.. the organic phase &,,, and the membrane D_/c. have generally about the same magnitude but if the distribution coefficient m is large most of the resistance is in the water phase Here i is the ratio of the solute concentration in the organic phase to that in the water phase

These devices should find practical application for systems where it is difficult to get a good dispersion or where emulsification makes the final phase separation difficult evaporation evaporation is a separation process in which one or more components of a liquid mixture diffuse through a selective membrane evaporate under how pressure on the downstream side and are removed by a vacuum pump or a chilled condenser come polite membranes are used with the dense layer in contact with the liquid and the porous supporting layer exposed to the vapor The phase change occurs in the memo brave and the heat of vaporization is supplied by the sensible heat of the liquid con ducted through the thin dense layer The decrease in temperature of the liquid as it passes through the separator lowers the rate of permeation and this usually limits the application of evaporation to removal of small amounts of feed typically 2 to 5 percent for onstage separation If a greater removal is needed several stages are used in series with intermediate healers Commercial units generally use flat-sheet membranes stacked in a filter press arrangements with spacers acting as product channels although spiral-wound membranes could also be used Hollow-fiber membranes are not as suitable because of the pressure drop from the permeate flow through the small-bore fibers The flux of each component is proportional to the concentration gradient and the diffusivity in the dense layer however the concentration gradient is often nonlinear because the membrane swells appreciably as it absorbs liquid and the diffusion coefficient in the fully swollen polymer may be 10 to 100 times the value in the dense swollen polymer furthermore when the polymer is swollen mainly by absorption of one component the diffusivity of other components is increased also This interaction makes it difficult to develop correlations for membrane permeability and selectivity For permeation of a single species the diffusivity can be expressed as an expo mental function of the concentration D = dye (26.38) where 8 is constant and i is the diffusivity at infinite dilution At steady state the flux across a film of thickness z is do to open ~ spy (26.39) be of be is larger than 1.0 and c is much smaller than can there is a several-fold decrease in diffusivity across the membrane and the flux is not proportional to the concentration difference For example if be = 2.0 and can = 0.5c,, the flux is we - e Do / be = 4.67 do be but lowering c to zero which doubles the concent ration difference only increases the flux to 6.39Do/Bz.a 37 percent increase however increasing c by 50 percent to double the driving force raises the flux to 17.4D)/B2, 23.7-fold increase

Other studies with pure feed liquids have given similar results and direct mean cerements have shown very nonlinear concentration profiles in the membrane however in commercial applications of pervaporation, the liquid feed usually has a low concentration of the more permeable species so the swelling of the memo brave and the resulting nonlinear effects are not as pronounced as when testing pure liquids or solutions of high concentration The gradients at steady state for a typical system are shown in fig 26.15. The feed is rich in be but A is assumed to be much more soluble in the polymer and there is a high concentration of A in the membrane at the upstream side The gradient of A is small near this boundary because of the high diffusivity but do decreases as c de creases The gradient of B has a similar shape reflecting the change in do through the membrane The concentrations can and can are likely to be proportional to the down stream partial pressure put and p,., but henry law may not hold at the upstream side where the membrane is highly swollen by solvent The concentration of a solvent in the membrane at the upstream side depends on its solubility in the polymer at the operating temperature and the activity of the solvent in the liquid The feed is usually heated because the membrane permeability increases 20 to 40 percent for a 10Â°C increase in temperature without much loss in selectivity The upstream pressure is 1 at or slightly higher to prevent partial vaporization of the feed It is not worthwhile to use very high pressure on the upstream side since the activity in the liquid phase increases only a small amount for a large increase in pressure The downstream pressure is kept as low as possible

Aqueous waste can be concentrated without heating to get a 20- to 30-fold decrease in waste volume greatly reducing the expense of final treatment or disposal.*â In some cases such as the concentration of electroplating solutions valuable metals can be recovered for reuse Reverse osmosis can also be used as an alternative to evaporation for concentrating natural products such as milk fruit juices and maple sap Apple juice has been concentrated to 30 percent solids in membrane units operating at up to 7 man however there was some loss of flavor and aroma compounds which slowly diffuse through the polymer membrane In the pro auction of maple syrup in which 40 gal of sap yield only 1 gal of syrup 90 percent of the water can be removed by reverse osmosis more cheaply than by evaporation The final stage of concentration requires evaporation because of the high osmotic pressure Concentration polarization The nearly complete rejection of solute by the membrane leads to a higher concentration at the membrane surface than in the bulk solution and this effect is called concentration polarization At steady state the solute carried to the membrane by the water flux almost equals the amount of solute diffusing back to the solution The gradient may be relatively small as shown in fig 26.17, or the solute concent ration at the membrane surface may be several times the bulk concentration con generation polarization reduces the flux of water because the increase in osmotic pressure reduces the driving force for water transport The solute rejection decreases both because of the lower water flux and because the greater salt concentration at the surface increases the flux of solute Equations for concentration polarization have been derived for simple cases such as laminar flow of feed solution between parallel plates or inside hollow fibers.** Numerical solutions were required because of the developing concentration boundary layer and the gradual decrease in solution flow rate as permeation occurs Exact solutions are not available for the more important cases of flow outside hollow fibers or in the channels of a spiral-wound module but an approximate analysis may still be helpful Consider a membrane with a water flux of ja cm7/s-cm* when the bulk solute concentration is c g/cm? and f is the fraction of solute rejected Diffusion of solute away from the membrane surface is characterized by a mass-transfer coefficient ka and driving force c,,;-~ Â¢,. where can is the solute concentration at the surface At steady state the diffusion flux equals the amount of solute rejected per unit area as fa release i eye (26.49) The polarization factor P is defined as the relative concentration difference pane 2 of (26.50) my ka

y CHAPTER 27 Crystallization Crystallization is the formation of solid particles within a homogeneous phase It may occur as the formation of solid particles in a vapor as in snow as solidification from a liquid meet as in the manufacture of large single crystals or as crystallization from liquid solution This chapter deals mainly with the last situation The concepts and principles described here equally apply to the crystallization of a dissolved solute from a saturated solution and to the crystallization of part of the solvent itself as in freezing ice crystals from seawater or other dilute salt solutions Crystallization from solution is important industrially because of the variety of materials that are marketed in the crystalline form Its wide use has a twofold basis A crystal formed from an impure solution is itself pure unless mixed crystals occur and crystallization affords a practical method of obtaining pure chemical substances in a satisfactory condition for packaging and storing magma In industrial crystallization from solution the two-phase mixture of mother liquor and crystals of all sizes which occupies the crystallized and is with drawn as product is called a magma Purity of product A sounds well-formed crystal itself is nearly pure but it retains mother liquor when removed from the final magma and if the crop contains crystalline agree gates considerable amounts of mother liquor may be occluded within the solid mass When retained mother liquor of low purity is dried on the product contain nation results the extent of which depends on the amount and degree of impurity of the mother liquor retained by the crystals In practice much of the retained mother liquor is separated from the crystals by filtration or centrifuging and the balance is removed by washing with fresh solvent The effectiveness of these purification steps depends on the size and uniformity of the crystals 929

a SBeTIUs the Mass Transfer and Its Applications Importance of crystal size clearly good yield and high purity are important objectives in crystallization but the appearance and size range of a crystalline product also are significant If the crystals are to be further processed reasonable size and size uniformity are desire able for filtering washing reacting with other chemicals transporting and storing the crystals If the crystals are to be marketed as a final product customer accept dance requires individual crystals to be strong nonaggregated, uniform in size and noncaking in the package For these reasons crystal size distribution (CSD) must be under control it is a prime objective in the design and operation of crystallizes CRYSTAL GEOMETRY A crystal is the most highly organized type of nonliving matter It is characterized by the fact that its constituent particles which may be atoms molecules or ions are arranged in orderly three-dimensional arrays called space latices As a result of this arrangement of the particles when crystals are allowed to form without hindrance from other crystals or outside bodies they appear as polyhedrons having sharp comers and flat sides or faces Although the relative sizes of the faces and edges of various crystals of the same material may be widely different the angles made by corresponding faces of all crystals of the same material are equal and are character fistic of that material Crystallographic systems Since all crystals of a definite substance have the same interfacial angles in spite of wide differences in the extent of development of individual faces crystal forms are classified on the basis of these angles The seven classes are cubic hexagonal trigonal tetragonal orthorhombic monoclinic, and triclinic A given material may crystallize in two or more different classes depending on the conditions of crystal libations Calcium carbonated for example occurs most commonly in nature in the hexagonal form was calcite but also occurs in the orthorhombic form (aragonite). Invariant crystals Under ideal conditions a growing crystal maintains geometric similarity during growth Such a crystal is called f@avariant, Figure 27.1 shows cross sections of an invariant crystal during growth Each of the polygons in the figure represents the outline of the crystal at a different time Since the crystal is invariant these dos torr sass FIGURE 271 . yo a = ~ of i is Growth of an invariant crystal SKRTETELL or of we SEES
Page 944:
CHAPTER 27: Crystallization 931 polygons are geometrically similar and the dotted lines connecting the corners of the polygons with the center of the crystal are straight The center point may be thought of as the location of the original nucleus from which the crystal grew The rate of growth of any face is measured by the velocity of translation of the face away from the center of the crystal in a direction perpendicular to the face Unless the crystal is a regular polyhedron the rates of growth of the various faces of an invalid ant crystal are not equal The size of a crystal may be specified by its characteristic length la defined as i do hence from a rearrangement of end (7.10). but be (27.1) so where my and so are the volume and the total surface area of the crystal respectively and i is the sphericity This is satisfactory with regular solids for which i is close to 1.0, but not for disks or needles with very small values of Â®,. In practice L is usually taken as equal to the size determined by screening The concept of invariant growth is useful in analyzing the crystallization process even though in most crystallizes the conditions are far from ideal and growth is often far from invariant In extreme cases one face may grow much more rapidly than any of the others giving rise to long needlelike crystals Slow growth of one face may give rise to tinplate or disk-shaped crystals typical of ice formed from aqueous solution Even with invariant crystals the different faces of a growing crystal normally have different translational velocities This can greatly alter the shape and appears once of the crystal By what is called the overlapping principle faces with low trash national velocities can dominate the growth process to the extent that faces with high velocities diminish and ultimately disappear Only faces with the lowest velocities survive When a crystal is being dissolved faces with low translational velocities disappear and only those with the highest velocities survive.'* EQUILIBRIA AND YIELDS Equilibrium in crystallization processes is reached when the solution is saturated and the equilibrium relationship for bulk crystals is the solubility curve was shown later the solubility of extremely small crystals is greater than that of crystals of order nary size Solubility data are given in standard tables.'Â°*?* Curves showing solus ability as a function of temperature are given in fig 27.2. Most materials follow curves similar to curve | for KNQ,; that is their solubility increases more or less rapidly with temperature A few substances follow curves like curve 2 for nail with lithe change in solubility with temperature others have what is called an inverted solubility curve curve 3 for MnSO,-H,O), which means that their solubility de creases as the temperature is raised Many important inorganic substances crystallize with water of crystallization In some systems several different hydrates are formed depending on the concentration and temperature and phase equilibria in such systems can be quite complicated The

Supersaturation Mass and enthalpy balances shed no light on the cod of the product from a crystallized Conservation laws are unchanged if the product is one huge crystal or a mush of small ones In the formation of a crystal two steps are required (1) the birth of a new particle and (2) its growth to macroscopic size The first step is called nucleation in cross tallier the cod is determined by the interaction of the rates of nucleation and growth and the overall process is complicated kinetically The driving potential for both rates is supersaturation and neither crystal growth nor formation of nuclei from the solution can occur in a saturated or unsaturated solution Of course very small crystals can be formed by attrition in a saturated solution and these may act just as new nuclei us sites for further growth if the solution later becomes supersaturated In the theories of nucleation and growth mole units are used in place of mass units Supersaturation may be generated by one or more of four methods If the solubility of the solute increases strongly with increase in temperature as is the use with many common inorganic salts and organic substances a saturated solution becomes supersaturated by simple cooling and temperature reduction If the soluble it is relatively independent of temperature as is the case with common salt super saturation may be generated by evaporating a portion of the solvent If neither cool in nor evaporation is desirable as when the solubility is very high supersaturation may be generated by adding a third component The third component may act pays really by forming with the original solvent a mixed solvent in which the solubility of the solute is sharply reduced This process is called salting or if a nearly come plate precipitation is required a new solute may be created chemically by adding a third component that will react with the original solute and form an insoluble sub stance This process is called precipitation By the addition of a third component the rapid creation of very large supersaturation is possible

CHAPTER 27: Crystallization 937 Units for supersaturation Supersaturation is the concentration difference between that of the supersaturated solution in which the crystal is growing and that of a solution in equilibrium with the crystal The two phases are very nearly at the same temperature Concentrations may be defined either in mole fraction of the solute denoted by ya or in moles of solute in unit volume of solution denoted by c Since only one component is transferred across phase boundaries component subscripts are omitted The two supersaturation are defined by the equations Ay=y-3, (27.2) Ac=c-Â¢, (27.3) where Ay = supersaturation mole fraction of solute y = mole fraction of solute in solution ya = mole fraction of solute in saturated solution a = molar supersaturation moles per unit volume i = molar concentration of solute in solution c = molar concentration of solute in saturated solution The supersaturation defined by else (27.2) and (27.3) are related by the equation a = put i boy's Q74) where put and pa are the molar densities of the solution and the saturated solution red spectively.

Although a coherent theory of crystal growth has evolved numerical data on i of a kind that can be used in design are scarce One theory is based on the concept that growth occurs layer by layer on the crystal face and that each new layer begins as a two-dimensional nucleus attached to the face This theory predicts that growth does not start until an appreciable threshold supersaturation is reached and that the rate of growth then increases rapidly until at some fairly high value of supersaturation it becomes linear with supersaturation actually the growth rate of most inorganic crystals is hear with supersaturation at all supersaturation even at very how values There seems to be no threshold value required The difference between the observed and theoretical growth rates has been reck nailed by the Frank screw dislocation theory Actual space lattices of real crystals

Perhaps because of cancellation of errors the a law is sufficiently precise in many situations to be usable and so it greatly simplifies the calculation of industrial processes CRYSTALLIZATION equipment Commercial crystallizes may operate either continuously or batchwise. Except for special applications continuous operation is preferred The first requirement of any crystallized is to create a supersaturated solution because crystallization cannot occur without supersaturation Three methods are used to produce supersaturation depends in primarily on the nature of the solubility curve of the solute (1) Solutes like potassium nitrate and sodium sulfite are much less soluble at low temperatures than at high temperatures so supersaturation can be produced simply by cooling (2) When the solubility is almost independent of temperature as with common salt or dining wishes as the temperature is raised supersaturation is developed by evaporation (3) In intermediate cases a combination of evaporation and cooling is effective Sodium nitrate for example may be satisfactorily crystallized by cooling without evaporation evaporation without cooling or a combination of cooling and evaporation Variations in crystallizes Commercial crystallizes may also be differentiated in several other ways One important difference is in how the crystals are brought into contact with the super saturated liquid In the first technique called the circularing-liquid method a stream of supersaturated solution is passed through a fluidized bed of growing crystals within which supersaturation is released by nucleation and growth The saturated liquid then is pumped through a cooling or evaporating zone in which supernatural ton is generated and finally the supersaturated solution is recycled through the crystallizing zone In the second technique called the circularing-magma method the entire magma is circulated through both crystallization and supersaturation steps without separating the liquid from the solid Supersaturation as well as cross palliation occurs in the presence of crystals In both methods feed solution is added to the circulating stream between the crystallizing and supersaturating zones One type of crystallized uses size classification devices designed to retain small crystals in the growth zone for further growth and to allow only crystals of a specie find minimum size to leave the unit as product ideally such a crystallized would pro duce a classified product of a single uniform size Other crystallizes are designed to maintain a thoroughly mixed suspension in the crystallizing zone in which crystals of all sizes from nuclei to large crystals are uniformly distributed throughout the magma ideally the size distribution in the product from a mixed suspension unit is identical to that in the crystallizing magma itself To make the average crystal size larger than that for a mixed-suspension unit some crystallizes are equipped with devices that segregate and remove most of the fine crystals from the crystallizing zone These small crystals are redissolved and returned to the crystallized Other crystallizes have two takeoff lines one for large

Vacuum crystallizes Most modern crystallizes fall i the category of vacuum units in which dial basic evaporative cooling is used to create supersaturation In its original and simp lest form such a crystallized is a closed vessel in which a vacuum is maintained by a condenser usually with the help of a steam-jet vacuum pump or booster placed between the crystallized and the condenser A warm saturated solution at a tempera sure well above the boiling point at the pressure in the crystallized is fed to the vessel A magma volume is maintained by controlling the level of the liquid and crystallizing solid in the vessel and the space above the magma is used for release of vapor and elimination of entrainment The feed solution cools spontaneously to the equilibrium temperature since both the enthalpy of cooling and the enthalpy of crystallization appear as enthalpy of vaporization a portion of the solvent vapor rates The supersaturation generated by both cooling and evaporation causes nuclei action and growth Product magma is drawn from the bottom of the crystallized The theoretical yield of crystals is proportional to the difference between the concentrate ton of the feed and the solubility of the solute at equilibrium temperature Figure 27.10 shows a continuous vacuum crystallized with the conventional auxiliary units for feeding the unit and processing the product magma The essential action of a single body is much he that of a single-effect evaporator and in fact these units can be operated in multiple effect The magma circulates from the cone bottom of the crystallized body through a downpipe to a low-speed bowhead circus eating pump passes upward through a vertical tubular heater with condensing steam in the shell and thence into the body The heated stream enters through a tangential inlet just below the level of the magic surface This imparts a swirling moon to the magma which facilitates flash evaporation and equilibrates the magma with the vapor through the action of an adiabatic flash The supersaturation thus generated provides the driving potential for nucleation and growth The volume of the magma divided by the volumetric flow rate of magma through the slurry pump gives the average residence time Feed solution enters the downpipe before the suction of the circulating pump Mother liquor and crystals are drawn off through a discharge pipe upstream from the feed inlet in the downpipe Mother liquor is separated from the crystals in a con unions centrifuge the crystals are taken off as a product or for further processing

Feed at this temperature would not flash if admitted at any level more than 300 my below the surface of the magma Admission of the feed at a point where it does not flash as in fig 27.10, is advantageous in controlling nucleation Because of the effect of static head evaporation and cooling occur only in the liquid layer near the magma surface and concentration and temperature gradients near the surface are formed Also crystals tend to settle to the bottom of the crystal liver where there may be little or no supersaturation The crystallized will not opera ate satisfactorily unless the magma is well agitated to equalize concentration and temperature gradients and suspend the crystals The simple vacuum crystallized provides no good method for nucleation control for classification or for removal of excess nuclei and very small crystals

Part of the circulating liquor is pumped to the bottom of the leg and used as a hydraulic sorting fluid to carry small crystals back into the crystallizing zone for further growth The action here is that of hindered-settling classification described in chap 29. The dish charge slurry is withdrawn from the lower part of the eluviation leg and sent to a filter or centrifuge and the mother liquor is returned to the erystallizer. Unwanted nuclei are removed by providing an annular space or jacket by enlarging the cone bottom and using the lower wall of the crystallized body as a baffled The annular space provides a settling zone in which hydraulic classification sepal rates fine crystals from larger ones by floating them in an upward-flowing stream of mother liquor which is withdrawn from the top of the settling zone The fine crystals . my FIGURE 27.11 else barometric _ i so Propeller drive draft tube-baffle crystallized condenser with internal system for fines Boiling surface separation and removal by permission from a do make , Randolph, chemo Eng..

The overflow scream is typically 8 to 12 times as large as the underflow stream and the residence time for large crystals is thus increased by about 10 times The classification can be accomplished by removing the overflow through a vertical pipe or baffled segment of the tank with the area chosen to give an upward velocity slightly greater than the terminal velocity of crystals of size up alternate lively a large overflow stream can be drawn directly from the tank and passed through a hydrophone see chap 29) with the oversize particles in the hydrophone underflow being returned to the tank The hydrophone overflow and a smaller uni derfiow stream from the tank are combined outside the crystallized and sent to a film her or other separator The population distribution in the combined product is strongly bimodal with one peak at about the same size as with mumps operation The second peak size may be several times as large as the first one and the average size 2 to 3 times that

Most of these exponents are for quite high supersaturation and a lower exponent might be found at low values of so Nucleation of organic crystals can occur either by heterogeneous processes such as particle-particle or particle-impelJer collisions or by homogeneous nuclei action following rapid addition of a nonsolvent. Homogeneous nucleation may be preferred for some products because it can produce fine crystals with a relatively narrow size distribution Homogeneous nucleation does not start immediately once supersaturation is achieved but only after an induction period which may be only several milliseconds or as long as a few seconds There are no general correlations for predicting nucleation kinetics but increasing the supersaturation generally de creases the induction time and increases the nucleation rate When two solutions are combined to make a highly supersaturated mixture the size distribution of the crystals formed depends on the method of mixing and the mixing time The mixing time is not the tank blending time discussed in chap 9 but the much shorter micromixing time that characterizes local blending of a feed stream with the immediately surrounding aside Sometimes the feed stream is added to the tank as a jet discharging near the tip of the impeller where the flow is highly turbulent Another method uses two impinging jets (TNs). which can be submerged or placed just above the liquid in the tank With a TI mixer mixing times shorter than 0.1 s can be obtained and if the mixing time is kept less than the induction period the particle size distribution is not much affected on scaleup."!

SECTION V Operations Involving Particulate Solids solids in general are more difficult to handle than liquids or gases In processing solids appear in a variety of formsâangular pieces continuous sheets finely did video powders They may be hard and abrasive tough and rubbery soft or fragile dusty cohesive free-flowing, or sticky Whatever their form means must be found to manipulate the solids as they occur and if possible to improve their handling characteristics As mentioned in chap 27, solids in chemical processes are most commonly in the form of particles This section is concerned with the properties modifications and separation of particulate solids General properties handling mixing and size reduction are discussed in chap 28, and mechanical separations in chap 29. 965

CHAPTER 28 Properties and Handling of Particulate Solids Of all the shapes and sizes that may be found in solids the most important from a chemical engineering standpoint is the small particles An understanding of the charm acteristics of masses of particulate solids is necessary in designing processes and equipment for dealing with streams containing such solids CHARACTERIZATION OF SOLID PARTICLES Individual solid particles are characterized by their size shape and density Particles of homogeneous solids have the same density as the bulk material Particles obtained by breaking up a composite solid such as a metal-bearing ore have various dense ties usually different from the density of the bulk material Size and shape are easily specified for regular particles such as spheres and cubes but for irregular particles such as sand grains or mica flakes the terms size and shape are not so clear and must be arbitrarily defined Particle shape As discussed in chap i the shape of an individual particle is conveniently expressed in terms of the sphericity Â®,, which is independent of particle size For a spherical particle of diameter D,,, i = i for a nonspherical particles the sphericity is defined by the relation and end up (28.1) soup where do = nominal diameter of particle so = surface area of one particle v = volume of one particle 967

968 SECTION v Operations Involving Particulate Solids An equivalent diameter can be defined as the diameter of a sphere of equal vole me For fine granular materials however it is difficult to determine the exact vole me and surface area of a particles and do is usually taken to be the nominal size based on screen analyses or microscopic examination The surface area may be found from the pressure drop in a bed of particles [Eq. (7.17) or (7.22)], or for none porous particles from adsorption measurements and end (28.1) used to calculate Â®,, For many crushed materials i is between 0.6 and 0.8, as shown in Table 7.1. but for particles rounded by abrasion it may be as high as 0.95. Table 7.1 shows that a cube a short cylinder and a sphere all have a sphericity of 1.0. For the same vole me a cube actually has 1.24 times as much surface area as a sphere but i = 1.0 because do is taken arbitrarily as the length of one side Particle size In general diameters may be specified for any equidimensional particles Particles that are not equidimensional, that is that are longer in one direction than in others are sometimes characterized by the second-longest major dimension By convention particle sizes are expressed in different units depending on the size range involved Coarse particles are measured in inches or millimeters fine part clues in terms of screen size very fine particles in micrometers or nanometers ultrafiche particles are sometimes described in terms of their surface area per unit muss usually in square meters per grams Mixed particle sizes and size analysis In a sample of uniform particles of diameter do the total volume of the part clues is nap where m and pa are the total mass of the sample and the density of the particles respectively Since the volume of one particle is v,,.the number of part clues in sample N is in no i (28.2) put The total surface area of the particles is from else (28.1) and (28.2), ans i ON (28.3) D.p,D, To apply else (28.2) and (28.3) to mixtures of particles having various sizes and densities the mixture is sorted into fractions each of constant density and approsi- lately constant size Each fraction can then be weighed or the individual particles in it can be counted or measured by any of a number of methods Equations (28.2) and (28.3) can then be applied to each fraction and the results added Information from such a particle size analysis is tabulated to show the mass or number fraction in each size increment as a function of the average particle size for size range in the increments An analysis tabulated in this way is called a differ entail analysis The results are often presented as a histogram as shown in fig 28. a with a continuous curve like the dashed line used to approximate the distribution A second way to present the information is through a cumulative analysis obtained by

Testing sieves are made of woven wire screens the mesh and dimensions of which are carefully standardized The openings are square Each screen is identified in meshes per inch The actual openings are smaller than those corresponding to the mesh numbers however because of the thickness of the wires The characteristics of one common series the taler standard screen series are given in happy 5. This set of screens is based on the opening of the 200-mesh screen which is established at 0.074 mind The area of the openings in any one screen in the series is exactly twice that of the openings in the next-smaller screen The ratio of the actual mesh dimension of any screen to that of the next-smaller screen is then of = 1.41. For closer sizing intermediate screens are available each of which has a mesh dimension 2/2. or 1.189, times that of the next-smaller standard screen Ordinarily these intermediate screens are not used In making an analysis a set of standard screens is arranged serially in a stack with the smallest mesh at the bottom and the largest at the top The sample is placed on the top screen and the stack shaken mechanically for a definite time perhaps 20 mind The particles retained on each screen are removed and weighed and the masses of the individual screen increments are converted to mass fractions or mass percentages of the total sample Any particles that pass the finest screen are caught in pan at the bottom of the stack The results of a screen analysis are tabulated to show the mass fraction of each screen increment as a function of the mesh size range of the increments Since the particles on any one screen are passed by the screen immediately ahead of it two

PROPERTIES OF MASSES OF PARTICLES Masses of solid particles especially when the particles are dry and not sticky have many of the properties of a fluid They exert pressure on the sides and walls of a container they flow through openings or down a chute They differ from liquids and gases in several ways however because the particles interlock under pressure and cannot slide over one another until the applied force reaches an appreciable magic dude Unlike most fluids granular solids and solid masses permanently resist distort ton when subjected to a moderate distorting force When the force ts large enough failure occurs and one layer of particles slides over another but between the layers on each side of the failure there is appreciable friction Solid masses have the following distinctive properties 1. The pressure is not the same in all directions In general a pressure applied in one direction creates some pressure in other directions but it is always smaller than the applied pressure It is a minimum in the direction at right angles to the applied pressure In a homogeneous mass the ratio of the normal pressure to the applied pressure p,/py, is a constant kid which is characteristic of the material It de pends on the shape and interlocking tendencies of the particles on the stickiness of the grain surfaces and on how tightly the material is packed It is nearly index pendent of particle size until the grains become very small and the material is no longer free-flowing. 2. shear stress applied at the surface of a mass is transmitted throughout a static mass of particles unless failure occurs 3. The density of the mass may vary depending on the degree of packing of the grains The density of a fluid is a unique function of temperature and pressure as is that of each individual solid particles but the bulk density of the mass is not The bulk density is a minimum when the mass is âloose.â It rises to a maximum when the mass is packed by vibrating or tamping i Before a mass of tightly packed particles can flow it must increase in volume to permit interlocking grains to move past one another Without such dilation flow is not possible 5. When granular solids are piled up on a flat surface the sides of the pile are at a definite reproducible angle with the horizontal This angle Â«,. is called the angle of repose of the material For free-flowing granular solids i is often between is and 30Â°. Depending on their flow properties particulate solids are divided into two classes cohesive and noncohesive. nonadhesive materials such as grain dry sand and plastic chips flow freely out of a storage bin or silo For these solids ka is often

Cohesive solids such as wet clay are characterized by their reluctance to flow through openings For them the value of ka approaches zero Storage and Conveying of Solids Bulk storage Coarse solids such as grave and coal are stored outside in large piles untrod tested from the weather When hundreds or thousands of tons of material are in valved this is the most economical method The solids are removed from the pile by dragline or tractor shovel and delivered to a conveyor or to the process Outdoor storage can had to environmental problems such as dusting or leaching of soluble material from the pile Dusting may necessitate a protective cover of some kind for the stored solid leaching can be controlled by covering the pile or by locating it in a shallow basin with an impervious floor from which the runoff may be safely withdrawn Bin storage Solids that are too valuable or too soluble to expose in outdoor piles are stored in bins hoppers or silos These are cylindrical or rectangular vessels of concrete or metal A silo is tall and relatively small in diameter a bin is not so tall and usually fairly wide A hopper is a small vessel with a sloping bottom for temporary storage before feeding solids to a process All these containers are loaded from the top by some kind of elevator discharging is ordinarily done from the bottom As discussed later a major problem in bin design is to provide satisfactory discharge Pressures in bins and silos When granular solids are placed in bin or silo the lateral pressure exerted on the walls at any point is Jess than predicted from the head of material above that point Furthermore there usually is friction between the wall and the solid grains and because of the interlocking of the particles the effect of this friction is felt throughout the mass The friction force at the wall tends to offset the weight of the solid and reduces the pressure exerted by the mass on the floor of the container The vertical pressure on the vessel floor or the packing support is much smaller than that exerted by a column of liquid of the same density and height The actual pressure from the solids depends on the value of ka for the solids the coefficient of friction between the solids and the vessel wall and the way the solids are placed in the vessel In general when the height of the solids column is greater than about 3 times the diameter of the container additional solids have no effect on the press sure at the based The total vinasse of course increases if more solids are added but the additional mass is carried by the walls and foundation not by the floor of the vessel In granular solids a high pressure does not always increase the tendency of the material to flow as it does in a liquid instead increased pressure packs the grains more tightly together and makes flow more difficult In extreme cases the combined ton of gravitational and friction forces at some point in the container causes the

CHAPTER 28: Properties and Handling of Particulate Solids 977 Conveyors Pneumatic conveyors for solids are described in chap 7. Other common devices for transportation include belt conveyors and bucket elevators closed-helt conveyors with zipperlike fasteners and various kinds of drag and flight conveyors These all include a return beg that carries the empty belt or chain back from the discharge to the loading point Vibrating conveyors and screw conveyors have no return leg but only operate over relatively short distances Pneumatic conveyors also have no return leg and are not so limited as to distance of travel Conveyors for solids are discussed in ref 12). MIXING OF SOLIDS The mixing of solids whether free-flowing or cohesive resembles to some extent the mixing of low-viscosity liquids Both processes intermingle two or more separate components to form a more or less uniform product Some of the equipment normally used for blending liquids may on occasion be used to mix solids Yet there are significant differences between the two processes Liquid blend in depends on the creation of flow currents which transport unmixed material to the mixing zone adjacent to the impeller In heavy pastes or masses of particulate solids no such currents are possible and mixing is accomplished by other means In consequences much more power is normally required in mixing pastes and dry solids than in blending liquids Another difference is that in blending liquids a âwell-mixedâ product usually means a truly homogeneous liquid phase from which random samples even of very small size all have the same composition In mixing pastes and powders the product often consists of two or more easily identifiable phases each of which may contain individual particles of considerable size From a âwell-mixedâ product of this kind small random samples will differ markedly in composition in fact samples from any given such mixture must be larger than a certain critical size several mes the size of the largest individual particle in the mix if the results are to be significant Measures of mixer performance Mixing is harder to define with solids and pastes than it is with liquids quantic native measures of mixing based on statistical procedures are sometimes used to evaluate mixer performance These procedures are based on analyses of spot samples taken from the mix at various times A mixture in which one component is randomly distributed through another is said to be completely mixed For granular nonadhesive solids multiple small samples containing about the same number of particles are used Consider a mixture of components A and B from which N spot samples each containing n particles are taken and analyzed The standard deviations s is estimated from the analytical results by the equation N N N Ye - yo a yes a is 2 | BE (28.12) not not

980 SECTION i Operations Involving Particulate Solids Mixers for Cohesive Solids Some of the most difficult of all mixing problems involve cohesive solids such as pastes plastic materials and rubber In some ways these substances resemble liquids but their enormously high viscosity means that the mixing equipment must be different from and much more powerful than the mixers described in chap 9. With cohesive solids the mixing elements cannot generate flow currents instead they shear fold stretch and compress the material to be mixed The mechanical energy is applied by moving parts directly to the mass of material The forces generated in these mixers are large and the power consumption is high Change-can mixers blend viscous liquids or light pastes as in food processing or paint manufacture in a removable agitated can or vessel 3 to 100 gal in size In the pony mixer shown in fig 28.3e the rotating agitator carries several vertical blades positioned near the vessel wall The can is driven by a turntable in a direction opposite to that of the agitators In the beater mixer in fig 28.36 the can is stationary and the agitator has a plan clary motion so that as it rotates it precesses repeatedly visiting all parts of the vessel Kneading machines mix deformable or plastic solids by squashing the mass flat folding it over and squashing it once more Most kneading machines also tear the mass apart and shear it between a moving blade and a stationary surface con miserable energy is required even with fairly thin materials and as the mass be comes stiff and rubbery the power requirements become very large A nvo-arm kneader handles suspensions pastes and light plastic masses type can applications are in the compounding of lacquer bases from pigments and carriers and in shredding cotton winters into acetic acid and acetic anhydride to form cellulose acetate A disperser is heavier in construction and draws more power than a kneader it works additives and coloring agents into stiff materials A masticator is still heavier and draws even more power It can disintegrate scrap rubber and compound the toughest plastic masses that can be worked at all masticator are often called intensive mixers i Device for D raising agitator we planetary gear SS = we Rotating _ ==" ) ) oh _ All is i | change can all ] i up range can a lug = of i Cart we a agitator blades AIRY a (>) FIGURE 28.3 Double-motion paste mixers a pony mixer be beater mixer

In some machines the blades overlap and turn at the same speed or with a speed ratio of 2:1. Designs of mixing blades for various purposes are shown in fig 28.4. The common sigma blade shown at the left is used for general-purpose kneading its edges may be serrated to give a shredding action The double-naben, or fishtail blade in the center is particularly effective with heavy plastic materials The diaper son blade at the right develops the high shear forces needed to disperse powders or liquids into plastic or rubbery masses Masticator blades are even heavier than those shown sometimes being little larger in diameter than the shafts that drive them spiral flattened and elliptical designs of masticator blades are used Material to be kneaded or worked is dropped into the trough and mixed for 5 to 20 in or longer Sometimes the mass is heated while in the machine but more commonly it must be cooled to remove the heat generated by the mixing action The trough is often unloaded by tilting it so that its contents spill out In some kneaders known as internal mixers the mixing chamber is closed duro in the operating cycle with a cover the underside of which conforms to the volume swept out by the blades Such mixers do not tilt They are used for dissolving rub be and for making dispersions of rubber in liquids The most common internal mixer is the Banbury mixer This is a heavy-duty two-arm mixer in which the agita tors are in the form of interrupted spirals The shafts turn at 30 to 40 rum Solids are charged in from above and held in the tough during mixing by an air-operated piss ton under a pressure of | to 10 at Mixed material is discharged through a hiding door in the bottom of the trough Banbury mixers compound rubber and plastic solids masticate crude rubber devuleanize rubber scrap and make water diaper signs and rubber solutions Batch kneaders can handle exceedingly tough materials although the more if fault the material is to mix the smaller the batch size must be Continuous knead ears mix light to fairly heavy gummy materials and can be incorporated into con tenuous industrial processes In a typical design a single horizontal shaft slowly turning in a mixing chamber carries rows of teeth arranged in a spiral pattern to move the material through the chamber The teeth on the rotor pass with close

In this particular design of muller the pan is stationary and the central vertical shaft is driven causing the muller wheels to roll in a circular path over a layer of solids on the pan floor The rubbing action results from the slip of the wheels on the solids Plows guide the solids under the muller wheels or to an open in in the pan floor at the end of the cycle when the mixer is being discharged In another design the axis of the wheels is held stationary and the pan is rotated in still another the wheels are not centered in the pan but are offset and both the pan and the wheels are driven Mixing plows may be substituted for the muller wheels to give what is called a pan mixer millers are good mixers for batches of heavy solids FIGURE 28.5 / Muller wheels = Muller mixer Stationary pan i per \ eel Plows i 4 need Driven shalt yet

984 SECTION van Operations Involving Particulate Solids SIZE REDUCTION The term size reduction is applied to all the ways in which particles of solids are cut or broken into smaller pieces Throughout the process industries solids are reduced by different methods for different purposes Chunks of crude ore are crushed to workable size synthetic chemicals are ground into powder sheets of plastic are cut into tiny cubes or diamonds Commercial products must often meet stringent speck indications regarding the size and sometimes the shape of the particles they contain Reducing the particle size also increases the reactivity of solids it permits separate ton of unwanted ingredients by mechanical methods it reduces the bulk of fibrous materials for easier handling and for waste disposal Solids may be broken in many different ways but only four are commonly used in size-reduction machines (1) compression (2) impact (3) attrition or rubbing and (4) cutting A nutcracker a hammer a file and a pair of shears exemplify these four types of action Sometimes size reduction results from the attrition of a particle by one or more other particles or from intense shear in the supporting fluid In general compression is used for coarse reduction of hard solids to give relatively few finest impact gives coarse medium or fine products attrition yields very fine products from soft nonabrasive materials Cutting gives a definite particle size and sometimes a definite shape with few or no finest Characteristics of comminuted products The objective of crushing and grinding is to produce small particles from larger ones Smaller particles are desired either because of their large surface or because of their shape size and number One measure of the efficiency of the operation is based on the energy required to create new surface since the surface area of a unit mass of particles increases greatly as the particle size is reduced Unlike an ideal crusher or grinder an actual unit does not yield a uniform prod cut whether the feed is uniformly sized or not The product always consists of a mixture of particles ranging from a definite maximum size to very small particles Some machines especially in the grinder class are designed to control the magic dude of the largest particles in their products but the fine sizes are not under control In some types of grinders fines are minimized but they are not eliminated If the feed is homogeneous both in the shapes of the particles and in chemical and pays kcal structure then the shapes of the individual units in the product may be quite uniform otherwise the grains in the various sizes of a single product may differ considerably in shape The ratio of the diameters of the largest and smallest particles in a comminuted product is on the order of 10Â°, Because of this extreme variation in the sizes of the individual particles relationships adequate for uniform sizes must be modified when applied to such mixtures The term average size for example is meaningless until the method of averaging is destined and as discussed earlier in this chapter several different average sizes can be calculated Unless they are smoothed by abrasion after crushing comminuted particles resemble polyhedrons with nearly plane faces and sharp edges and comers The part titles may be compact with length breadth and thickness nearly equal or they may be plantlike or needlelike.

CHAPTER 28: Properties and Handling of Particulate Solids 985 Energy and power requirements in commination The cost of power is a major expense in crushing and grinding so the factors that control this cost are important During size reduction the particles of feed material are first distorted and strained The work necessary to strain therm is stored temporarily in the solid as mechanical energy of stress just as mechanical energy can be stored in a coiled spring As additional force is applied to the stressed part close they are distorted beyond their ultimate strength and suddenly rupture into fragments New surface is generated Since a unit area of solid has a definite amount of surface energy the creation of new surface requires work which is supplied by the release of energy of stress when the particle breaks By conservation of energy all energy of stress in excess of the new surface energy created must appear as heat efficiency Size reduction is one of the least energy-efficient of all the unit operations Laboratory studies of crushing have shown that less than | percent of the energy delivered to the solids is used to create new surface the rest is dissipated as heat In operating machines energy must also be supplied to overcome friction in the bearings and other moving parts The mechanical efficiency the ratio of the end orgy delivered to the solids to the total energy input to the machine ranges from 25 to 60 percent's Crushing laws and work index Crushing laws proposed many years ago by Rittinger and Kick have been shown to apply only over a very limited range of conditions A more realistic way of estimating the power required for crushing and grinding was proposed by bond Bond postulated that the work required to form particles of size do from very large feed is proportional to the square root of the surface-to-volume ratio of the product 5,/v,.

The breakage function AB,,,, gives the size distribution resulting from the break age of the upper material Some of the 4/6-mesh material after breaking would be fairly coarse some very small and some in between Probably very little would be as large as 6/8-mesh, and only a small amount as small as 200-mesh. One would expect sizes in the intermediate range to be favored Consequently AB,,,, varies with both and up Furthermore it varies with the composition of the material in the mill since coarse particles may break differently in the presence of large amounts of fines than they do in the absence of finest In a batch mill therefore abs and so also would be expected to vary with time as well as with all the other milling variables If abs i and so are known or can be assumed the rate of change of any given fraction can be found as follows For any fraction except the coarsest the initial amount is diminished by breakage to smaller sizes and simultaneously augmented by the creation of new particles from breakage of all coarser fractions If the input and output from a given screen are at equal rates the fraction retained on that screen remains constant usually however this is not the case and the mass fraction retained on screen 7 changes according to the equation . cool on = âS,x, + dprwSi an a (28.19) Equation (28.19) can be simplified if it is assumed that so and abs are constant and analytical and matrix solutions are available for this case.'~â but these assume tons are highly unrealistic In crushing coal for particles larger than about 28-mesh, so has been found to vary with the cube of the particle size and the break age function to depend on the reduction ratio do dye according to the equation 5 B bra = of (28.20) my where the exponent 6 may be constant or may vary with the value of be

These mills all contain a high-speed rotor turning inside a cylindrical casing Usually the shaft is horizontal Feed dropped into the top of the casing is broken and falls out through a bottom opening In a hammer mill the particles are broken by sets of swing hammers pinned to a rotor disk A particle of feed entering the grinding zone cannot escape being struck by the ham mess It shatters into pieces which fly against a stationary anvil plate inside the casing and break into still smaller fragments These in turn are rubbed into powder by the hammers and pushed through a grate or screen that covers the discharge opening Several rotor disks 150 to 450 my i to 18 in in diameter and each carrying four to eight swing hammers are often mounted on the same shaft The hammers may be straight bars of metal with plain or enlarged ends or with ends sharpened to cutting edge Intermediate hammer mills yield a product 25 my i in to 20-mesh in particle size In hammer mills for fine reduction the peripheral speed of the ham me tips may reach 110 mes (360 ft/s); they reduce 0.1 to 15 tons to sizes finer than

Hammer mills grind almost anythingâtough fibrous solids like bark or leather steel turnings soft wet pastes sticky clay hard rock For fine reduction they are limited to the softer materials The capacity and power requirement of a hammer mill vary greatly with the nap sure of the feed and cannot be estimated with confidence from theoretical consider actions They may be found from published information or better from small-scale or full-scale tests of the mill with a sample of the actual material to be ground Commercial mills typically reduce 60 to 240 keg of solid per kilowatthour (100 to 400 Ib/hp- he of energy consumed An impactor, illustrated in fig 28.7, resembles a heavy-duty hammer mill except that it contains no grate or screen Particles are broken by impact alone with out the rubbing action characteristic of a hammer mill impacts are often primary reduction machines for rock and ore processing up to 600 tons/h. The rotor in an impactor, as in many hammer mills may be run in either direction to prolong the life of the hammers Roller mills In a roller mill solids are caught and crushed between vertical cylindrical rollers and a stationary anvil ring or bull ring The rollers are driven at moderate speeds in a circular path Plows lift the solid limps from the floor of the mill and direct them between the ring and the rolls where the reduction takes place Product is swept out of the mill by a stream of air to a classifier separator from which oversize particles are returned to the mill for further reduction In a bow mill and some roller mills the bow or ring is driven the rollers rotate on stationary axes which may be vertical or horizontal Mills of this kind find greatest application in the reduction of limestone cement clinker and coal They pulverize up to 50 tons/h. When classification is used the product may be as fine as 99 percent through a 200- mesh screen Attrition mills In an attrition mill particles of soft solids are rubbed between the grooved flat faces of rotating circular disks In a singJe-runner mill one disk is stationary and one rotates in a double-runner machine both disks are driven at high speed in opposite directions Feed enters through an opening in the hub of one of the

Single-runner mills contain disks of buhrstone or rock emery for reducing solids such as clay and talc or metal disks for solids such as woods starch insecticide powders and carnauba wax Metal disks are usually of white iron although for corrosive materials disks of Stainless steel are sometimes necessary Double-runner mills in general grind to finer products than single-runner mills but process softer feeds Air is often drawn through the mill to remove the product and prevent choking The disks may be cooled with water or refrigerated brine The disks of a single-runner mill are 250 to 1,400 my (10 to 54 in in diameter turning at 350 to 700 remind Disks in double-runner mills turn faster at 1,200 to 7,000 remind The feed is precrushed to a maximum particle size of about 12 my i in and must enter at a uniform controlled rate Attrition mills grind from ! to 8 tons to products that will pass a 200-mesh screen The energy required depends strongly on the nature of the feed and the degree of reduction accomplished and is much higher than in the mills and crushers described so far Typical values are between 8 and 80 kph (10 and 100 hp-h) per ton of product Tumbling mills A typical tumbling mill is shown in fig 28.9. A cylindrical shell slowly turning about a horizontal axis and filled to about one-half its volume with a solid grinding medium forms a tumbling mill The shell is usually steel lined with high-carbon steel plate porcelain silica rock or rubber The grinding medium is metal rods in a rod mill lengths of chain or balls of metal rubber or wood in a ball mill flint pebbles or porcelain or zircon spheres in a pebble mill For internet date and fine reduction of abrasive materials tumbling mills are unequaled

The grinding may be done with dry solids but more commonly the feed is a suspension of the particles in water increasing both the capacity and the efficiency of the mill When the mill is rotated the balls are picked up by the mill wall and carried nearly to the top where they break contact with the wall and fall to the bottom to be picked up again Centrifugal force keeps the balls in contact with the walk and with one another during the upward movement While in contact with the wall the bails do some grinding by slipping and rolling over one another but most of the grinding occurs at the zone of impact where the free-falling balls strike the bottom of the mill The faster the mill is rotated the farther the balls are carried up inside the mill and the greater the power consumption and the capacity of the mill If the speed is too high however the balls are carried over and the milk is said to be centrifuging The speed at which centrifuging occurs is called the critical speed From a balance between the gravitational and centrifugal forces the critical speed not may be found from the equation new + is (28.21) in err where g is the acceleration of gravity R is the radius of the mill and r is the radius of the grinding elements The operating speed 1 must be less than 2,.

Fluid energy mills In these mills the particles are suspended in a high-velocity gas stream In some designs the gas flows in a circular or elliptical path in others there are jets that oppose one another or vigorously agitate a fluidized bed Some reduction occurs when the particles strike or rub against the walls of the confining chamber but most of the reduction is believed to be caused by interparticle attrition Internal classified cation keeps the larger particles in the mill until they are reduced to the desired size The suspending gas is usually compressed air or superheated steam admitted at a pressure of 7 at (100 Ib,/in.â) through energizing nozzles In the mill shown in fig 28.10 the grinding chamber is an oval loop of pipe 25 to 200 my i to 8 in in diameter and 1.2 to 2.4 m i to 8 to high Feed enters near the bottom of the loop through a venture injector Classification of the ground particles takes place at the Material and FIGURE 28.10 spent fluid outlet Fluid-energy mill by permission Fluid to Energy Processing and Equipment come if els i get f : =âtiâ Classifier outlet o i i lot a try the By end Feed I box of | ya per | PS are 7 we ma my fits i KEY t f injector see No i So Reduction chamber _ we Air oF stop Energizing nozzles

yo CHAPTER 29 Mechanical Separations Separations are extremely important in chemical manufactureâin fact much pro messing equipment is devoted to separating one phase or one material from another Separations are divided into two classes One class known as diffusional opera tons involves the transfer of material between phases as discussed in chaps i to 27. Another class known as mechanical separations is the subject of this chapter Mechanical separations for heterogeneous mixtures include methods of sepal rating solid particles from gases or liquids separating liquid drops from gases or other liquids and separating one type or size of solids from a mixture of particles The techniques are based on physical properties of the particles such as size shape and density and on the density and viscosity of the aside Two general methods are (1) the use of a screen septum or porous membrane that retains one component and allows the other to pass and (2) the utilization of differences in sedimentation rates as particles or drops move through a gas or liquid Membrane separation can also be used for homogeneous solutions of macromolecules such as proteins or polymers that are larger than the pores in the membrane Other special methods or separation exploit differences in the testability or the electrical or magnetic properties of the substances but these are not discussed here In these separations thermodynamics is not a factor as it is in the equations in chap 17 for diffusional separations SCREENING Screening is a method of separating particles according to size alone In industrial screening the solids are dropped on or thrown against a screening surface The undersize particles or finest pass through the screen openings oversize particles or tails do not A single screen can make but a single separation into two fractions These are called united fractions because although either the upper or lower limit 1001

(1.2- to 3-m) screen draws about 4 he i kw Comparison of ideal and actual screens The objective of a screen is to accept a feed containing a mixture of particles of various sizes and separate it into two fractions an underflow that is passed through the screen and an overflow that is rejected by the screen Either one or both of these streams may be a product An ideal screen would sharply separate the feed mixture in such a way that the smallest particle in the overflow would be just larger than the largest particle in the underflow Such an ideal separation defines a cut diameter D,,, that marks the point of separation between the fractions Usually D,,. is chosen to be equal to the mesh open in of the screen Actual screens do not give a perfect separation about the cut damn ever The closest separations are obtained with spherical particles on standard testing screens but even here there is an overlap between the smallest particles in the over flow and the largest ones in the underflow The overlap is especially pronounced when the particles are needlelike or fibrous or where the particles tend to aggregate into clusters that act as large particles Commercial screens usually give poorer sepal rations than testing screens of the same mesh opening operating on the same mixture Material balances over screen Simple material balances can be written over a screen which are useful in call curating the ratios of feed oversized and underflow from the screen analyses of the three streams and knowledge of the desired cut diameter Let fa do and B be the

As the particle size is reduced screening becomes progressively more difficult and both the capacity and efficiency are in general low for particle sizes smaller than 150-mesh (0.) mm). filtration GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Filtration is the removal of solid particles from a fluid by passing the fluid through a filtering medium or septum on which the solids are deposited Industrial filtrate tons range from simple straining to highly complex separations The fluid may be a liquid or a gas the valuable stream from the filter may be the fluid or the solids or both Sometimes it is neither as when waste solids must be separated from waste liquid prior to disposal In industrial filtration the solids content of the feed ranges from a trace to a very high percentage Often the feed is modified in some way by pretreatment to increase the filtration rate as by heating recrystallizing or adding a filter aid such as cellulose or diatomaceous earth Because of the enormous variety of materials to be filtered and the widely differing process conditions many types of filters have been developed i a few of which are described in fig 29.3. Fluid flows through a filter medium by virtue of a pressure differential across the medium Filters are also classified therefore into those that operate with a press sure above atmospheric on the upstream side of the filter medium and those that opera ate with atmospheric pressure on the upstream side and a vacuum on the downstream side Pressures above atmospheric may be developed by the force of gravity acting on column of liquid by a pump or blower or by centrifugal force Centrifugal filters are discussed in later section of this chapter in gravity filter the filter medium can be no finer than a coarse screen or a bed of coarse particles like sand Gravity filters are there fore restricted in their industrial applications to the draining of liquor from very coarse crystals the clarification of potable water and the treatment of wastewater. Most industrial filters are pressure filters vacuum filters or centrifugal separate torso They are also either continuous or discontinuous depending on whether the discharge of filtered solids is steady or intermittent During much of the operating cycle of a discontinuous filter the flow of fluid through the device is continuous but it must be interrupted periodically to permit discharging the accumulated solids In a continuous filter the discharge of both solids and fluid is uninterrupted as long as the equipment is in operation Filters are divided into three main groups cake filters clarifying filters and crossbow filters Cake filters separate relatively large amounts of solids as a cake of

Often they include provisions for washing the cake and for removing some of the liquid from the solids before dish charge Clarifying filters remove small amounts of solids to produce a clean gas or sparkling clear liquids such as beverages The solid particles are trapped inside the filter medium as shown in fig 29.38, or on its external surfaces Clarifying filters differ from screens in that the pores of the filter medium are much larger in dime her than the particles to be removed In a crossbow filter the feed suspension flows under pressure at a fairly high velocity across the filter medium fig 29.3Â¢). A thin layer of solids may form on the surface of the medium but the high liquid velocity keeps the layer from building up The filter medium is a ceramic metal or polymer membrane with pores small enough to exclude most of the suspended particles Some of the liquid passes through the medium as clear filtrate leaving a more con contracted suspension behind As discussed later an ultrafilter is a crossbow unit containing a membrane with extremely small openings used for the separation and concentration of colloidal particles and large molecules CAKE FILTERS At the start of filtration in a cake filter some solid particles enter the pores of the medium and are immobilized but soon others begin to collect on the septum sure face After this brief initial period the cake of solids does the filtration not the

Thorough washing in a filter press may take several hours for the wash liquid tends to follow the easiest paths and to bypass tightly packed parts of the cake Shell-and-leaf filters For filtering under higher pressures than are possible in a plate-and-frame press to economize on labor or where better washing of the cake is needed a shell-and-leaf filter may be used In the horizontal-tank design shown in fig 29.5, a set of vertical leaves is held on a retractable rack The unit shown in

A horizontal drum with a slotted face turns at 0.1 to 2 remain in an agitated slurry trough A filter medium such as canvas cove ears the face of the drum which is partly submerged in the liquid Under the slotted cylindrical face of the main drum is a second smaller drum with a solid surface Between the two drums are radial partitions dividing the annular space into separate compartments each connected by an internal pipe to one hole in the rotating plate of the rotary valve Vacuum and air are alternately applied to each compartment as the drum rotates A strip of filter cloth covers the exposed face of each compartment to form a succession of panels Consider now the panel shown at A in fig 29.6. It is just about to enter the slurry in the trough As it dips under the surface of the liquid vacuum is applied through the rotary valve A layer of solids builds up on the face of the panel as liquid is drawn through the cloth into the compartment through the internal pipe through the valve and into a collecting tank As the panel leaves the slurry and enters the washing and drying zone vacuum is applied to the panel from a separate system sucking wash liquid and air through the cake of solids As shown in the flow sheet of fig 29.7, wash liquid is drawn through the filter into a separate collecting tank After the cake of solids on the face of the panel has been sucked as dry as possible the panel leaves the drying zone vacuum is cut off and the cake is removed by scraping it off with a horizontal knife known as a doctor blade A little air is blown in under the cake to belly out the cloth This cracks the cake away from the cloth and makes it unnecessary for the knife to scrape the drum face itself Once the cake is dislodged the panel reenters the slurry and the cycle is repeated The operation of any given panel therefore is cyclic but since some panels are in each part of the cycle at all times the operation of the filter as a whole is continuous Many variations of the rotary-drum filter are commercially available In some designs there are no compartments in the drum vacuum is applied to the entire

CHAPTER 29: Mechanical Separations 1013 Rotary-drum pressure filters Continuous rotary vacuum filters are sometimes adapted to operate under posit give pressures up to about 15 at for situations in which vacuum filtration is not feasible or economical This may be the case when the solids are very fine and filter very slowly or when the liquid has a high vapor pressure has a viscosity greater than 1 pa or is a saturated solution that will crystallize if cooled at all With slow filtering flurries the pressure differential across the septum must be greater than can be obtained in a vacuum filter with liquids that vaporize or crystallize at reduced pressure the pressure on the downstream side of the septum cannot be less than at mospheric. however the mechanical problems of discharging the solids from these filters their high cost and complexity and their small size limit their application to special problems Where vacuum filtration cannot be used other means of separate tiny such as continuous centrifugal filters should be considered precept filters A precept filter is a rotary-drum filter modified for filtering small amounts of fine or gelatinous solids that ordinarily plug a filter cloth In the operation of this machine a layer of porous filter aid such as diatomaceous earth is first deposited on the filter medium Process liquid is then sucked through the layer of filter aid depositing a very thin layer of solids This layer and a little of the filter aid are then scraped off the drum by a slowly advancing knife which continually exposes a fresh surface of porous material for the subsequent liquor to pass through A precept filter may also operate under pressure In the pressure type the discharged solids and filter aid collect in the housing to be removed periodically at atmospheric pressure while the drum is being reported with filter aid precept filters can be used only where the solids are to be discarded or where their admixture with large amounts of filter aid introduces no serious problem The usual submergence of a precoat-filter drum is 50 percent Horizontal belt filter When the feed contains coarse fast-settling particles of solid a rotary-drum filter works poorly or not at all The coarse particles cannot be suspended well in the slurry trough and the cake that forms often will not adhere to the surface of the filter drum In this situation a topped horizontal filter may be used The moving belt filter shown in fig 29.8 is one of several types of horizontal filter it resembles a belt conveyor with a transversely ridged support or drainage belt carrying the filter cloth which its also in the form of an endless belt Central openings in the drainage belt slide over a longitudinal vacuum box into which the filtrate ts drawn Feed slurry flows onto the belt from a distributor at one end of the unit filtered and washed cake is discharged from the other Belt filters are especially useful in waste treatment since the waste often contains a very wide range of particle sizes They are available in sizes from 0.6 to 5.5 m i to 18 to wide and 4.9 to 33.5 m (16 to 110 to long with filtration areas up to 110 and (1,200 ft?). Some models are indexing belt filters similar in action to the large pressure filler described earlier in these the vacuum is intermittently cut off and reap plied The belt is moved forward one-half a meter or so when the vacuum is off and is held stationary while vacuum is applied This avoids the difficulty of maintaining a good vacuum seal between the vacuum box and 4 moving belt

Automatic batch centrifuges A short-cycle automatic batch centrifuge is illustrated in fig 29.10. In this machine the basket rotates at constant speed about a horizontal axis Feed slurry wash liquid and screen rinse are successively sprayed into the basket at appropriate intervals for controlled lengths of time The basket is unloaded while turning at full speed by a heavy knife that rises periodically and cuts the solids out with consider able force through a discharge chute Cycle timers and solenoid-operated valves control the various parts of the operation feeding washing spinning rinsing and unloading Any part of the cycle may be lengthened or shortened as desired The basket in these machines is between 500 and 1,100 my (20 and 42 in in diameter Automatic centrifuges have high productive capacity with free-draining Limit switch 9 See i unloader control i a | | cylinder Perforated basket ~ Ss i of A fly Be fa <\_, Unloader knife a MF so i et eS My i a limb are red a to - we i i H be 0 i & law my i my Feed eS to ya Chute a valve a f I z ya solids discharge oh fry | 4 .

CHAPTER 29: Mechanical Separations 1017 crystals Usually they are not used when the feed contains many particles finer than 150-mesh. With coarse crystals the total operating cycle ranges from 35 to 90 so so that the hourly throughput is large Because of the short cycle and the small amount of holdup required for feed slurry filtrate and discharged solids automatic cent tributes are easily incorporated into continuous manufacturing processes The small batches of solid can be effectively washed with small amounts of wash liquid and as in any batch machineâthe amount of washing can be temporarily increased to clean up off-quality material should it become necessary Automatic centrifuges cannot handle slow-draining solids which would give uneconomically long cycles or solids that do not discharge cleanly through the chute There is also considerable breakage or degradation of the crystals by the unloader knife Continuous filtering centrifuges A continuous centrifugal separator for coarse crystals is the reciprocating conveyor centrifuge shown in fig 29.11. A rotating basket with a slotted wall is fed through a revolving feed funnel The purpose of the funnel is to accelerate the feed slurry gently and smoothly Feed enters the small end of the funnel from a stationary pipe at the axis of rotation of the basket It travels toward the large end of the funnel gaining speed as it goes and when it spills off the funnel onto the wall of the basket it ts moving in the same direction as the walk and at very nearly the same speed Liquor flows through the basket wall which may be covered with a woven metal cloth A layer of crystals 25 to 75 my i to 3 in thick is formed This layer is moved over the filtering surface by a reciprocating pusher Each stroke of the pusher moves the crystals a few inches toward the lip of the basket on the return stroke a space is opened on the filtering surface in which more cake can be deposited When the crystals reach the lip of the basket they fly outward into a large casing and drop into a collector chute figurate and any wash liquid that is sprayed on the crystals during Basket Feed pipe Reciprocating Hows \ Screen | piston rod i - servomotor pop i Piston of ; i Feed funnel J pa = = a | Wash pipe my J i - Access door | | we i spray nozzle | Lo ~ / \ : i 7 Solids discharge ââââ 5. liquor discharge i Wash discharge FIGURE 29,11 Reciprocating-conveyor continuous centrifuge

They debater and wash 0.3 to 25. tons of solids contain in no more than about 10 percent by weight of material finer than 100-mesh. Filter Media The septum in any filter must meet the following requirements 1. It must retain the solids to be filtered giving a reasonably clear filtrate 2. It must not plug or blind 3. It must be resistant chemically and strong enough physically to withstand the process conditions 4. It must permit the cake formed to discharge cleanly and completely 5. It must not be prohibitively expensive In industrial filtration a common filter medium is canvas cloth either duck or twill weave Many different weights and patters of weave are available for different services Corrosive liquids require the use of other filter media such as woolen cloth metal cloth of money or stainless steel glass cloth or paper Synthetic fabrics such as nylon polypropylene and various polyesters are also highly resistant chemically.*"! teacloth of a given mesh size smooth synthetic or metal fibers are less effective than the more ragged natural fibers in removing very fine particles ordinarily however this is a disadvantage only at the start of filtration because except with hard coarse particles containing no fines the actual filtering medium is not the septum but the first layer of deposited solids Filtrate may first come through cloudy then grow clear Cloudy filtrate is resumed to the slurry tank for refiltration. Filter Aids Slimy or very fine solids that form a dense impermeable cake quickly plug any filter medium that is fine enough to retain them Practical filtration of such materials requires that the porosity of the cake be increased to permit passage of the liquor at a reasonable rate This is done by adding a filter aid such as diatomaceous silica perlite purified wood cellulose or other inert porous solid to the slurry before filtration The filter aid subsequently may be separated from the filter cake by dish solving away the solids or by burning out the filter aid If the solids have no value they and the filter aid are discarded together Another way of using a filter aid is by precoating, that is depositing a layer of it on the filter medium before filtration In batch filters the precept layer is usually think in a continuous precept filter as described previously the layer of precept is thick and the top of the layer is continually scraped off by an advancing knife to

1022. SECTION v Operations Involving Particulate Solids resistance of such a cake is sensitive to the method used in preparing the slurry and to the age and temperature of the material also the flocs are distorted and broken down by the forces existing in the cake and the factors i my and sp/vp, vary from layer to layer Such a filter cake is called compressible In a compressible cake a varies with distance from the septum since the cake nearest the septum is subject to the greatest compressive force and has the lowest void fraction This makes the press sure gradient nonlinear as shown in fig 29.12. The local value of a may also vary with time In consequences end (29.12) does not strictly apply In practice however the variations in @ with time and location are ignored An average value is obtained experimentally for the material to be filtered using end (29.13) for the calculations Filter medium resistance A filter medium resistance run can be defined by analogy with the cake resistance am,/A. The equation is ' my = Pi Pe = am (29.16) we up In SI units run is expressed in kPa/[kPa-s- (m/s)} or ma's Typical values are in the range of 10'Â° to la's m7!. The filter medium resistance run may vary with the pressure drop since the higher liquid velocity caused by a large pressure drop may force additional particles of solid into the filter medium Resistance run also varies with the age and cleanliness of the filter medium but since it is important only during the early stages of filtration it is nearly always satisfactory to assume that it is constant during any given filtration and to determine its magnitude from experimental data When run is treated as an empirical constant it also includes any resistance to flow that may exist in the pipes leading to and from the filter From easy (29.13) and (29.16), me a = ape + any = pul + and (29.17) strictly the cake resistance a is a function of ape rather than of ape During the important stage of the filtration when the cake is of appreciable thickness ape is small in comparison with ape and the effect on the magnitude of @ of carrying the integration of end (29.12) over a range a instead of ape can be safely ignored In end (29.17), then @ is taken as a function of ape In using end (29.17) it is convenient to replace up the linear velocity of the filtrate and my the total mass of solid in the cake by functions of v the total volume of filtrate collected to time i Equation (29.8) relates u and v and a material balance relates my and v If i is the mass of the particles deposited in the filter per unit vole me of filtrate the mass of solids in the filter at time is we and my we (29.18)

Equation (29.25) should not be used in a range of pressure drops much different from that used in the experiments conducted to evaluate ay and so EXAMPLE 29.1. Laboratory filtration conducted at constant pressure drop on a slurry of bacon in ho gave the data shown in Table 29.1.

This diffusion stage of washing may start when about one-half to two-thirds of the solution in the cake has been displaced For a bed of porous particles the additional holdup in the pores and the tower effective diffusive it prolong the diffusion stage and require more wash volume for a given percent age removal Data for cake washing can be shown as a plot of relative concentration versus time or wash volume or more usefully as a plot of the fraction of solute remaining re obtained by integrating the concentration data to get the total removed Typical results for washing a filter cake of aluminum rehydrate to remove nah and Na,CO, are shown in fig 29.17." The wash ratio 7 is the volume of wash liquid did video by the volume of solution in the cake In this example 75 percent removal was obtained at 1 = 1.0, compared to 100 percent removal for an ideal displacement wash and 98 percent removal required n = 2.0. Note that the line for displacement wash is curved on this epilog plot---it would be linear on an arithmetic plot The logarithmic scale is used for convenience and the data often fall on a nearly straight line This might suggest a first-order removal process but mathematical models for the diffusion wash are much more complex The rate of solute removal in the if fusion stage depends on the particle size shape and porosity as well as on the if fusion coefficient but few experimental studies are available For effective washing the wash liquid should be applied uniformly over the end tire surface of the cake This can be done with horizontal belt filters and rotary drum filters but is difficult or impossible to achieve with the vertical cakes in a filter press or leaf filter In the usual press slurry enters each frame at a top corner and cake forms on both sides until the frame is full of solid If wash water is added at the feed point or at the opposite corner only a small fraction of the cake can be washed Good washing is possible if only half the frames are used for cake formation with the alternating open frames used to send wash water through the cakes Wash water then flows through the entire cake thickness and the wash rate for a given pressure drop is only half the final filtration rate If really thorough washing is red squired the cake from a filter press can be broken up and suspended in a large vole me of wash water and filtered again suspension and filtration can be repeated

(29.68) where do = shear-induced diffusivity emits y = shear rate so r = particle radius am This equation when combined with end (29.53) and the equation for laminar flow mass transfer [Eq. (17.64)], gave a reasonable fit to limiting flux data in several studies of microfiltration.*â More work is needed to understand the effects of particle shape and size distribution and to extend the correlation to turbulent flow although the permeate flux increases with crossbow velocity velocities greater than a few meters per second are usually impractical because of the large pressure drop Another way of providing high shear at the membrane surface is to use a rotating filter plate or a rotating disk very close to the filter plate Several devices of this type have been tested and shown to give fluxes of 100 to 300 L/m?-h. GRAVITY SEDIMENTATION PROCESSES Many mechanical separations are based on the sedimentation of solid particles or liquid drops through a fluid impelled by the force of gravity or by centrifugal force This section deals with gravity settling and the next with centrifugal sedimentation The fluid may be a gas or liquid it may be flowing or at rest In some situations the objective of the process is to remove particles from a stream in order to eliminate contaminants from the fluid or to recover the particles as in the elimination of dust and fumes from air or flue gas or the removal of solids from liquid wastes In other problems particles are deliberately suspended in fluids to obtain separations of the particles into fractions differing in size or density The fluid is then recovered sometimes for reuse from the fractionated particles
Page 1068:
1086 see ton v Operations Involving Particulate Solids The principles of particle mechanics that underlie the separations described here are discussed in chap 7. If a particle starts at rest with respect to the fluid in which it is immersed and is then moved through the fluid by an external force its motion can be divided into two stages The first stage is a short period of accelerate tiny during which the velocity increases from zero to the terminal velocity The second stage is the period during which the particle is at its terminal velocity Since the period of initial acceleration is short usually on the order of tenths of a second or less initial-acceleration effects are short-range. Terminal velocities on the other hands can be maintained as long as the particle is under treatment in the equipment Equations such as (7.30) and (7.32) apply during the acceleration period and equations such as (7.40) and (7.43) during the terminal-velocity per ride Some separation methods such as jigging and tabling depend on differences in particle behavior during the acceleration period Most common methods how ever including all those described here make use of the terminal-velocity period only Particles heavier than the suspending fluid may be removed from a gas or liquid in a large settling box or settling tank in which the fluid velocity is low and the particles have ample time to settle out Simple devices of this kind however have limited usefulness because of the incompleteness of the separation and the labor required to remove the settled solids from the floor of the vessel Industrial separators nearly all provide for the continuous removal of settled solids The separation may be partial or very nearly complete A settler that removes virtually all the particles from a liquid is known as a clarified whereas a device that separates the solids into two fractions is called a classifier The same principles of sedimentation apply to both kinds of equipment Gravity classifiers Most classifiers in chemical processing separate particles on the basis of size in situations in which the density of the fine particles is the same as that of the larger ones The eluviation leg of the crystallized shown in fig 27.11 is an example By adjusting the upward velocity of the liquid so that it is smasher than the terminal settling velocity of acceptably large crystals this device carries unwanted fine cross talk back to the crystallizing zone for further growth Mechanical classifiers are used in closed-circuit grinding especially in metal surgical operations Here the relatively coarse particles are called sands and the slurry of fine particles is called slimes Sufficient time is provided to allow the sands to settle to the bottom of the device the slimes leave in the effluent liquid In a typical mechanical classifier the settling vessel is a semicylindrical trough set at an angle of about 12Â° with the horizontal with a liquid overflow at the lower end Slurry is fed continuously to the middle of the trough The flow rate is adjusted so that fines do not have time to settle but are carried out with the overflow liquid Larger particles sink to the floor of the trough A rotating helical conveyor moves the settled solids upward along the floor of the trough out of the pool of liquid and up to the sands discharge chute Such a classifier works well with coarse particles where exact splits are not required Typical applications are in connection with ball or rod mills for reduction to particle sizes between i and 20-mesh.

CHAPTER 29: Mechanical Separations 1057 Sorting classifiers Devices that separate particles of differing densities are known as sorting classic first They use one or the other of two principal separation methods sink-and-float and differential settling Sink-and-float methods A sink-and-float method uses a liquid sorting medium the density of which is intermediate between that of the light material and that of the heavy Then the heavy particles settle through the medium and the lighter ones float and a separation is thus obtained This method has the advantage that in principle the separation depends only on the difference in the densities of the two sub stances and is independent of the particle size This method is also called heavy-fluid separation Heavy-fluid processes are used to treat relatively coarse particles usually greater than 10-mesh. The first problem is to choose a liquid medium of the proper density to allow the light material to float and the heavy to sink True liquids can be used but since the specific gravity of the medium must be in the range of 1.3 to 3.5 or greater there are only a few liquids that are sufficiently heavy cheap nontoxic and noncorrosive to be practicable Halogenated hydrocarbons and call solutions have been used for this purpose A more common choice of medium is a pseudoliq- did consisting of a suspension in water of fine particles of a heavy mineral mags petite specific gravity 5.17), ferrosilicon specific gravity 6.3 to 7.0), and galena specific gravity 7.5) are used The ratio of mineral to water can be varied to give a wide range of medium densities Provision must be made for feeding the mixture to be separated for removing overflow and underflow and for recovering the separate in fluid which may be expensive relative to the value of the materials being treated Hindered settling is used Cleaning coal and concentrating ores are common apply cations of sink and float Under proper conditions clean separations between materials differing in specific gravity by only 0.1 have been claimed.â! Differential settling methods differential settling methods utilize the differ once in terminal velocities that can exist between substances of different density The density of the medium is less than that of either substance The disadvantage of the method is that since the mixture of materials to be separated covers a range of particle sizes the larger light particles settle at the same rate as the smaller heavy ones and a mixed fraction is obtained In differential settling both light and heavy materials settle through the same medium This method brings in the concept of equal-settling particles Consider part titles of two materials A and B settling through a medium of density pa Let material A be the heavier for example component A might be galena specific gravity 7.5) and component B quartz specific gravity 2.65).

CHAPTER 29: Mechanical Separations 1059 Equations (29.71) and (29.72) show that the sharpness of separation is imp proved if the density of the medium is increased It is also clear from fig 29.32 that the mixed fraction can be reduced or eliminated by closer sizing of the feed For example if the size range of the feed is from do to do in fig 29.32, complete sept ration is possible clarifies and thickeners Gravity separation under hindered settling conditions is often used to convert a dilute slurry of fine particles into a clarified liquid and a concentrated suspension This process is carried out in large open tanks called thickeners or clarifies The concentrated suspension or sludge may have to be filtered to produce a drier prod cut but the cost of the filtration step is much lower than if the original slurry had been filtered directly The clarified liquid is free or nearly free of suspended part close and it may be reused as process water or discharged as waste flocculation If the solids in a suspension are mainly individual particles only a few micrometers in diameter the gravity settling rate will be very how and perhaps too low for practical operation fortunately in many fine suspensions the particles form agglomerates or clusters of particles that settle at reasonable rates Agglomeration is sometimes promoted by adding flocculating agents including strong electrolytes which reduce the repulsive forces between the charged particles or polymeric floccus wants that may be cationic anionic or nontoxic in character Flocculation is also carried out by adding inexpensive materials such as lime alumina or sodium silicate which form loose agglomerates that carry fines down with them Flocculated particles have different settling characteristics from suspensions of dispersed dense solids The aggregates have a high porosity and retain a consider able amount of water that accompanies the flocs when they settle The aggregates are also loosely bonded and the sludge at the bottom of the settler compresses under the weight of additional solids Because the size shape and effective density of the flocs are not readily definable it is not possible to predict the setting rate or the sludge density from theories or general correlations The thickener design is generally based on measurements of the settling rates obtained from batch tests in the laboratory Batch sedimentation These are several stages in the settling of a flocculated suspension and different zones are formed as sedimentation proceeds usually the concentration of solids is high enough that sedimentation of individual particles or flocs is hindered by other solids to such an extent that all solids at a given level settle at a common velocity At first the solid is uniformly distributed in the liquid as shown in fig 29.33a. The total depth of the suspension is Z,). After a short time the solids have settled to give a zone of clear liquid zone A in fig 29.33, and a zone D of settled solids Above zone D is a transition layer zone c in which the solids content varies from that in the original pulp to that in zone do In zone be the concentration is uniform and equal to the original concentration since the settling

Eventually zone B disappears and all the solids are in zones C and D see fig 29.33d). meanwhile the gradual accumulation of solid puts stress on the material at the bottom which compresses solids in layer do Compression breaks down the structure of the flocs or aggregates and liquid is expelled into the upper zones Sometimes liquid in the flocs spurts out of zone D as small geysers as layer D compresses finally when the weight of the solid is balanced by the compressive strength of the flocs the settling process stops as shown in fig 29.33e. The entire process shown in fig 29.33 is called sedimentation Rate of sedimentation Atypical plot of interface height the boundary between zones A and be versus time is shown in fig 29.34. During the early stages of settling the velocity is constant as shown by the first portion of the curve When zone B disappears the rate of settling starts to decrease and steadily drops until the ultimate height is reached For the example shown the interface height was still decreasing at 20 he and the ultimate height was only estimated flurries vary greatly in their settling rates and in the relative heights of various zones during settling The initial rate is a function of the feed concentration but in the late stages the settling rate also depends on the initial height zip since compress son effects are more important with the thicker sludge layers Experimental studies of the settling rate for different initial heights and concentrations are needed for the design of a thickener Equipment for sedimentation thickeners industrially the above process is conducted on a large scale in equipment called thickeners For relatively fast-settling particles a batch settling tank or continuous

These data cover only the declining flux portion of the curve and the dashed line shows the approximate shape of the curve for low concentrations Usually a thickener operates at a high underflow concentration and the design is based on the declining flux part of the curve Different methods have been proposed for establishing the settling flux curve and they often give different results In the method of come and Clevenger,'â the in till settling velocity is measured for several suspensions with concentrations between the feed and desired underflow concentrations and the settling velocity is multiplied by the initial concentration to get the settling flux This assumes that the settling rate depends only on concentration but in practice the settling rate may also depend on the concentration-time history of the suspension Only one batch settling curve is needed for the lynch method which was used to prepare fig 29.36.

The cyclone is one of the few separation devices that work better at full load than at partial load Sometimes two identical cyclones are used in series to get more come plate solids removal but the efficiency of the second unit is Jess than that of the first because the feed to the second unit has a much lower average particle size The pressure drop in a cyclone is proportional to the gas density and the square of the inlet velocity It does not depend on the density of the solid particles sure prisingly, the pressure drop actually decreases somewhat with increasing particle concentration Liquid-solid separations hydroclones*"4â Cyclones are also used for separating solids from liquids sometimes as thick enters but much more commonly as classifiers In these services they are called hydrocyclones or hydroclones.

For dilute feeds the cut diameter varies with the 1.5 power of the cyclone diameter so for a given pressure drop a small diameter gives better separation than a large one hydrophones are therefore small They range in diameter from 10 my (0.4 in to about 1.2 m (48 in.). To handle large flows many small hydrophones are connected in parallel with as many as 480 ten-mm units manifolded in a single assembly The cut size is a weak function of the pressure drop for dilute feeds it varies with Ap~Â°?5, Hence large pressure drops are not economical Large hydrophones operate with a a of about | at in small ones a is 4 to 5 at hydrophones find applications in regretting operations in alumina production removing carbon in upgrading gypsum for phosphoric acid manufacture classify in pigments and crystal magmas and similar process steps They have largely replaced mechanical classifiers in closed-circuit grinding Centrifugal decanters Immiscible liquids are separated industrially in centrifugal decanters as de scribed in chap 2.

For application to industrial centrifuges end (29.83) is modified as follows Radius re and thickness s are replaced by re and so respect lively which are appropriate average values of r and s for the type of centrifuge under consideration The right-hand side of end (29.83) is multiplied and divided by go the gravitational acceleration and all factors relating to the centrifuge are collected in one group and those relating to the solids and liquid in another This gives Vw", Dip i rE go = of if gs 184 = 22u,y (29.84) where i the sigma value is a characteristic of the centrifuge and up is the terminal selling velocity of the particles under gravity settling conditions physically i is the cross-sectional area of a gravity settling tank of the same separation capacity as the centrifuge Typical values are given in Table 29.4. A 19.5-in (0.5-m) disk cent trifuge, for example is equivalent to a gravity sedimented with an area of over 10Â° to (10Â° mÂ°*).

He proposed a model in which liquid flows in a thin boundary layer over an essentially stagnant liquid pond The critical separation takes place in this layer for once a particle moves from the boundary layer into the pond it is effectively removed unless later suspended mechanically A thin boundary layer gives better separation than a thick one The total pond volume is not important the pond needs to be no deeper than necessary to ensure that the compacted solids are well below the surface In an axial flow conveyor centrifuge the scroll is cut away in the feed and see mentation sections to form a ribbon conveyor operating near the bow wall leave in the liquid surface undisturbed The boundary layer can then flow in an axial direction from the feed point to the liquid discharge Turbulence is minimized in the feed zone and at the liquid exit by the design of the flow channels Longitudinal vanes in the sedimentation section make sure the liquid in the boundary layer rotates at full bowl speed these vanes set at an angle with the radial direction also function as the disks of a disk centrifuge reducing the distance that a particle must settle before it strikes a solid surface Once this occurs the particle is unlikely to be resuspended. In a full-scroll centrifuge fig 29.44) the liquid flows in a spiral path against the motion of the conveyor Under these conditions the boundary layer is as much as 10 times as thick as it's when the layer flows only in an axial direction further more spiral flow induces eddies and turbulence in the boundary layer impeding sedimentation with axial flow the boundary layer is in laminar flow and sediment station is unimpeded wills and Shapiroâ give i values for axial flow centrifuges The addition of vanes can increase i by 3 to 4 times

CHAPTER 29: Mechanical Separations 1077 Centrifugal classifiers During the passage of the liquid through a centrifuge bowl the heavier larger solid particles are thrown out of the liquid finer lighter particles may not settle in the time available and may be carried out with the liquid effluent As in a gravity hydraulic classifier solid particles can be sorted according to size shape or specific gravity In a centrifugal classifier the separating force is on the order of 600 times the force of gravity permitting sharp separations of particles 1 jam or less in damn ever Much coarser particles than this however are also classified in centrifugal machines The high settling force in a centrifuge means that practical settling rates can be obtained with much smaller particles than in a gravity classifier While the higher force does not change the relative settling velocities of small particles it does over come the small but disturbing effects of free convection currents and brownies motion in a gravity classifier and it permits separation in some cases where none is possible in a gravity unit With coarse particles the settling regime may be changed so that a particle that settles by gravity according to stokes law may settle in the intermediate or Newton law regime in a centrifuge Thus mixtures of equal-settling particles from a gravity unit may sometimes be partially separated in a centrifuge On the other hands loose flocs or weak agglomerates which settle rapidly in a grave it thickener are often broken up in a centrifugal classifier and settle slowly or not at all despite the increased force for sedimentation SYMBOLS A area my or ftâ; a total area of continuous filter a area of inner surface of material in centrifuge a area of outer surface of material in centrifuge a logarithmic mean of a and you a arithmetic mean of a and a B Underflow from screen ugh or blah b Width of centrifuge basket m or it can Initial concentration of solute in the filtrate kg/mâ. gold or Ib/ftÂ® re Mass of solid deposited in filter per unit volume of filtrate kg/m? or Ib/ft*; also concentration of solids in suspension kg/mâ, gold or loafer cops in feed can In permeates Â¢,, critical concentration in thickener an concentration at which a gel layer forms in ultrafiltration; c,,, in pores of medium Cope optimum value can in feed slurry also at surface in ultrafiltration; Â¢,, in thickener underflow can in feed to sedimentary can can local retentive and permeate concentrations D Overflow from screen ugh or mho also diameter or pore size my jzm,or it do Width or diameter of impingement target m or it do Particle size m or to Dis of heavy particles Dap of light particles dos cut diameter do Shear-induced diffusivity cm?/s, see end (29.68)] do Volumetric diffusivity m*/h, cm/s, or ft2/h; do effective diffusivity defined by end (29.63); door diffusivity in pores
